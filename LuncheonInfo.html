    <p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Monthly Luncheon for E-Systems/Raytheon
          Retirees</b></font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica">The informal monthly Retirees Luncheon
        meeting is held the last Wednesday of each month at the Furr's
        Fresh Buffet, 1540 Eastgate Drive, Garland, TX 75041, &nbsp;
        Most people
        arrive at 11 AM. Everyone </font><font face="Helvetica">pays
        his own
        bill</font><font face="Helvetica"> and selects whatever he or
        she wants
        to
        eat. We
        all sit together in
        the meeting room.&nbsp;
        Attendance usually runs from 40 to 60 people. Spouses are
        welcome.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica">After we have finished eating, our meeting
        leader Dottie Vaughn gives us any news she has on people that
        have
        passed away or are ill
        and how they are doing. Occasionally she passes around get well
        cards
        for us to sign. If there is any news from the company she will
        also
        pass that on. On occasion we have special speakers from the
        company
        and sometimes from local professionals who want to make a
        presentation that is deemed to be of interest to the majority of
        retirees. This is always at the end and you are welcome to leave
        if
        you are not interested in the particular presentation that
        month.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica">During your meal and after the meeting
        breaks up, you are welcome to visit with old friends and see
        what
        they have been doing with themselves in retirement.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Helvetica">A list of luncheon attendees and their
        home
        address and email address is normally available at the meeting.
        You
        can also sign up to be on the email distribution of the
        list.</font></p>
