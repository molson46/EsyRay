<h3>Announcements</h3>   
  
<article>
  <h4>Mailing FSA Claims</h4>
  <p>You can still mail Medical Claims for  reimbursement. </p>
  <P>Use the old form and mail the claim to:</P>

  <p>If anyone is interested the 1099-R is available for your pension. Go to rtxpensioncenter.com, select Bank of New York Mellon, scroll to the bottom and you'll find "Tax Forms". You may have to use the slider bar, it's on the far right under Action.
Update: I think it’s pdf format only and you may need to tell your browser to allow popups for that website.
    
  <h4>NOTE:</h4>
  <p>Paper pension statements will not be mailed out any longer. You must now view your pension statement on rtxpensioncenter.com. If your direct deposit looks off, better check. Some people have reported being double charged for their medical deductions (Dental, etc.).</p>

    <h4>Benefits Administrator Change</h4>
    <p>This info was posted on our Facebook group.</p>
    <p>Alight has a benefits "Gateway" website that will be used for benefits administration. If you haven’t created an account yet you can use this link to do so, (<a href="https://rtxhealthyyou.com/enrollment-2">https://rtxhealthyyou.com/enrollment-2"</a>). The instructions indicate to go to <a href="www.yourtotalrewards.com/rtx">www.yourtotalrewards.com/rtx</a> and select "New user?". The "New user?" selection links to a couple of identifying questions and then steps you through the account setup. It recognized me and I was able to set up my account so I could create my profile and preferences. There’s also an online chat feature to talk with a benefits representative and find out additional details about benefits changes. They had my old employee email address in my profile and I had to call Alight to get that corrected (800-243-8135). Be sure to check your beneficiary information. This was blank for me so I corrected that.</p>


    <p>Alight will manage the medical reimbursement and (if it works like intended) we will be able to check our DDB balance, submit claims, authorize direct deposit, etc. online.</p>

    <p>RTX is also moving the 401K administration from Fidelity to Alight. The 401K change to Alight will not impact you if you've rolled over your 401K to personal IRA. <a href="www.yourtotalrewards.com">www.yourtotalrewards.com</a></p>

    <h4>My Back Porch</h4>
    <p>On the first day, God created the dog and said, "Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years."</p>
    <p>The dog said, "That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?"</p>
    <p>And God saw it was good.</p>
    <p>On the second day, God created the monkey and said, "Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span."</p>
    <p>The monkey said, "Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?"</p>
    <p>And God, again saw it was good.</p>
    <p>On the third day, God created the cow and said, "You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years."</p>
    <p>The cow said, "That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?"</p>
    <p>And God agreed it was good.</p>
    <p>On the fourth day, God created humans and said, "Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years."</p>
    <p>But the human said, "Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back,</p>
    <p>the ten the monkey gave back,</p>
    <p>and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?"</p>
    <p>"Okay," said God, "You asked for it."</p>
    <p>So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.</p>
    <p>For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.</p>
    <p>For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. </p>
    <p>And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.</p>
    <p>Life has now been explained to you.</p>
    <p>There is no need to thank me for this valuable information.</p>
    <p>I'm doing it as a public service.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for me I will be on the front porch...</p>

<h3>Deaths</h3>

<h4 class="h4Head">Morton Spooner</h4>
 <h4 class="h4Head">Jan. 16, 1924-Nov. 27, 2021</h4>
 <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/MortSpooner.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
<p>Morton Spooner, a former resident of East Aurora, died on Saturday, November 27. He was 97.</p>
<p>Mr. Spooner grew up on an 80-acre dairy farm, outside of Eau Claire, Wis., and was the youngest of a family of six children. On the day of his birth, his father hitched the horse to a sleigh and took his mother seven miles to the hospital. </p>
<p>Mr. Spooner attended a rural two-room school one mile from the farm. He either walked or skied to school. The school was heated by coal, tended by the teacher with water supplied by an outside hand pump. The class had four students. He finished the eighth grade with the highest grades in the rural county.</p>
<p>He went to Eau Claire High School, in a class with 450 students. He milked cows twice per day, working around his studies. He excelled and was the salutatorian of his class.</p>
<p>Shortly after entering the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, Pearl Harbor was attacked and plans changed. Mr. Spooner enlisted in the Army Signal Corps and studied electronics in Chicago at the Illinois Institute of Technology. He spent five months at Northwestern University studying Electrical Engineering and radar. His formal enlistment in the Army followed with basic training in Miami Beach then further training in blind bombing radar equipment aboard B-17 bombers. He transferred to England, serving during the Battle of the Bulge in 1944. Months after V-E day, his group boarded the Queen Mary in Glasgow along with 10,000 other troops for the five-day trip to New York to support the invasion of Japan. The two atomic bombs were dropped, Japan surrendered and Mr. Spooner was discharged in November 1945.</p>
<p>Upon discharge from the service, Mr. Spooner enrolled at the University of Wisconsin. He met Nelsine Hanshus, a nursing student. They were married on July 1, 1950. </p>
<p>Mr. Spooner received his Electrical Engineering Ph.D. in 1956 and accepted a position with the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (CAL) in Buffalo, owned by Cornell University. He participated in early research in artificial intelligence and teaching computers to read. He was part of a team developing the first automatic fingerprint reader for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>
<p>Mr. Spooner became vice president of electronics for the company. The Vietnam War came with protests about classified military research programs. As a result, Cornell University terminated its association with CAL.  </p>
<p>In 1976, Mr. Spooner joined E-Systems, headquartered in Dallas. He led several top-secret special access proposal efforts engaging in classified advanced computer processing for various US intelligence agencies. He was awarded a Distinguished Service Citation by the University of Wisconsin for his work in electrical and computer engineering. </p>
<p>Mr. Spooner and his family resided in East Aurora, famous for its Roycroft heritage and Fisher-Price toys. Mr. Spooner served on the school board for nine years, serving as president for three years, including when a new high school was built. </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Spooner were active and founding members of Nativity Lutheran Church on Main Street and Mr. Spooner served on the church council when the first chapel was built.  They were also founding members of Wood Spring and members of the East Aurora Country Club.</p>
<p>Mr. Spooner was devoted to his wife and children, encouraging education and sports. East Aurora is still the family’s hometown.</p>
<p>Mr. Spooner retired in 1991 and moved to Naples, Fla. There, he played golf and honed duplicate bridge skills with his wife. They even served as bridge directors on 23 international cruises. </p>
<p>In 2003, Mr. and Mrs. Spooner moved into a continuing care facility (CCRC) in St Augustine, Fla. There, they established a duplicate bridge club and Mr. Spooner wrote his autobiography. He discovered that his Norwegian immigrant father changed the family surname from Spone to Spooner. </p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Spooner were married for 71 years. During his final illness, Mr. Spooner was comforted by a recitation consisting of a list of his family, beginning with his wife, Nelsine; his four children MarySue, Ted, Shelley, Andy, and their spouses; and his ten grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Family was his life, his great joy, and his peace. Mr. Spooner was an amazing role model to them all and will be missed by all whom he touched.</p>

<h4 class="h4Head">Ted Ryden</h4>
 <h4 class="h4Head">February 21, 1936 - December 05, 2021</h4>
 <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/TedRyden.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
<p>Our Papa - Theodore (Ted) Eugene Ryden, beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend, passed into eternity with Jesus on December 5, 2021. He was born on February 21, 1936, in Phoenix, Arizona as the son of Harold and Gretchen Ryden, and brother to Deanna. On August 25, 1960, Ted married the love of his life, Nancy Pauline Huffman. Grandma and Papa remained joyously married for nearly 57 years. Papa missed Grandma since her passing in 2017 more than words can express. Our grandparents' marriage was fruitful, and the legacy they built lives on today.</p>
<p>Ted is survived by his daughter, Kim Dorsett and husband Keith of College Station, Texas, and their two children Cameron and Anna; his son, Brad Ryden and wife Becky of Orlando, Florida, and their four children Alex, Ethan, Audrey, and Eliot; and his daughter, Wendy Aubin and husband Justin of Northlake, Texas, and their daughter Emma.</p>
<p>Papa accepted Jesus Christ as his Lord and Savior as a young child and then again, with a stronger understanding of what being "born again" meant, as a young adult. Papa loved his wife, three children, and seven grandchildren (that's us!), and devoted his life to being a witness for Christ. He taught himself Spanish so he could visit and communicate with prisoners and share the Gospel with them. Our grandparents volunteered in Bill Glass' "Behind the Walls" prison ministry for many years; they were also longtime members at Trinity Bible Church in Richardson. Papa retired from Raytheon-E Systems in 1991.</p>

<p>We, the grandchildren, liked to describe our beloved Papa as funny, kind, loving, intelligent, humble, fascinating, eccentric, heroic, wise, curious, an adventurer, full of life, a continuous learner and teacher, and a God-fearing, Christlike, and Spiritual man. Papa is greatly missed here.</p>

<p>A celebration of Papa's life will take place at 11:00 AM on February 21, 2022, in the Chapel at Denton Bible Church (2300 E University Drive, Denton, Texas 76209). Donations can be made to Bill Glass' "Behind the Walls" prison ministry at www.behindthewalls.com</p>

After 40+ years, he retried and returned to Colbert. He was a simple man. He didn’t require a lot. His greatest love besides gardening was his family that brought him so much joy. He loved basketball and didn’t miss a game his granddaughters played in all throughout high school. He would find a ride somewhere and somehow.</p>

 <h4 class="h4Head">Gretchen Hopkins</h4>
 <h4 class="h4Head">1955 – February 11, 2022</h4>
 <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/GretchenHopkins.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
 <p>Gretchen Ceil Hopkins of Rockwall, Texas passed away unexpectedly on February 11, 2022, just six days after the passing of her beloved husband, Gary Hopkins who she lovingly cared for over recent years as he suffered with Parkinson’s.</p>
 <p>She was born on May 19, 1955 in Dallas, Texas to George and Mildred Werner. In 1973 after graduation from Bryan Adams High School, she landed her first job with the Dallas County Health Department.</p>
 <p>Eventually she launched a successful career with E-Systems Garland, one of the leading defense electronics companies in the United States. She later transferred to the Greenville Division, continuing a career that spanned over 30 years. Early in her E-Systems career, she met Gary, the love of her life. They married on September 1, 1990 in Dallas, beginning a devoted, loving relationship of over 31 years. While employed full-time, Gretchen also attended and earned a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Letourneau University.</p>
 <p>Gretchen and Gary were very hospitable and generous and loved to entertain and host family get-togethers. They enjoyed taking spur-of-the-moment road trips and taking in an occasional casino. They were huge Dallas Cowboys fans and especially enjoyed cheering on Gary's alma mater team, the University of Oklahoma Sooners. Gretchen loved gardening and celebrating and decorating and sending cards for every holiday.</p>
 <p>She was brave, strong, and courageous as she twice fought breast cancer and survived the disease. She had a strong passion for animals, especially her three cats (Rambo, Catnip and Chester) who she loved to spoil. She fully earned the title of Cat Mom. She was beautiful, loving and kind and will live forever in our hearts.</p>
 <p>Gretchen is survived by her brother, Vincent Werner and his wife MK of Plano, Texas, sister, Kristen Steege and her husband Arnie of Austin, Texas, nieces Dr. Bethany Werner and Geneva Werner, nephew George Werner, Jr. (Melissa), niece, Jennifer Richey (Cory) and great-nephews and great-nieces and cousins. She is also survived by her step-children, Cary Evans and her husband Mike, Erin Stanley and her husband Kevin and Carter Hopkins and his wife Amie. She was a beloved "Nana" to her six grandchildren and great-granddaughter. Gretchen was preceded in death by her husband, Gary Hopkins, parents George and Mildred Werner and brothers George and John Werner.</p>
 <p>An Afternoon of Remembrance for Gretchen and Gary will be held Saturday, February 26, 2022 from 2:00-4:00 pm with words of remembrance spoken at 3:00 p.m. at Allen Family Funeral Options. </p>
 <p>Gary and Gretchen will be laid to rest together at the DFW National Cemetery.</p>
 <p>In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to your local Humane Society or Vitas Hospice at vitascommunityconnection.org</p>

    <h4>My Back Porch</h4>
    <p>On the first day, God created the dog and said, "Sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. For this, I will give you a life span of twenty years."</p>
    <p>The dog said, "That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?"</p>
    <p>And God saw it was good.</p>
    <p>On the second day, God created the monkey and said, "Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span."</p>
    <p>The monkey said, "Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?"</p>
    <p>And God, again saw it was good.</p>
    <p>On the third day, God created the cow and said, "You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years."</p>
    <p>The cow said, "That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?"</p>
    <p>And God agreed it was good.</p>
    <p>On the fourth day, God created humans and said, "Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years."</p>
    <p>But the human said, "Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back,</p>
    <p>the ten the monkey gave back,</p>
    <p>and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?"</p>
    <p>"Okay," said God, "You asked for it."</p>
    <p>So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.</p>
    <p>For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.</p>
    <p>For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. </p>
    <p>And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.</p>
    <p>Life has now been explained to you.</p>
    <p>There is no need to thank me for this valuable information.</p>
    <p>I'm doing it as a public service.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for me I will be on the front porch...</p>

    <p>The dog said, "That's a long time to be barking. How about only ten years and I'll give you back the other ten?"</p>
    <p>And God saw it was good.</p>
    <p>On the second day, God created the monkey and said, "Entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. For this, I'll give you a twenty-year life span."</p>
    <p>The monkey said, "Monkey tricks for twenty years? That's a pretty long time to perform. How about I give you back ten like the dog did?"</p>
    <p>And God, again saw it was good.</p>
    <p>On the third day, God created the cow and said, "You must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. For this, I will give you a life span of sixty years."</p>
    <p>The cow said, "That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. How about twenty and I'll give back the other forty?"</p>
    <p>And God agreed it was good.</p>
    <p>On the fourth day, God created humans and said, "Eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. For this, I'll give you twenty years."</p>
    <p>But the human said, "Only twenty years? Could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back,</p>
    <p>the ten the monkey gave back,</p>
    <p>and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?"</p>
    <p>"Okay," said God, "You asked for it."</p>
    <p>So that is why for our first twenty years, we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves.</p>
    <p>For the next forty years, we slave in the sun to support our family.</p>
    <p>For the next ten years, we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. </p>
    <p>And for the last ten years, we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.</p>
    <p>Life has now been explained to you.</p>
    <p>There is no need to thank me for this valuable information.</p>
    <p>I'm doing it as a public service.</p>
    <p>If you are looking for me I will be on the front porch...</p>

 <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/FrankFranceshetti.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
<p>Frank Charles Franceschetti, 62, of Stafford County passed away Monday, October 18, 2021 at his home. Frank was a devoted family man who was always there when anyone needed him. He was just as committed to animals as people, and received great enjoyment interacting with his pets. He appreciated being able to spend time in nature, and enjoyed hobbies such as woodworking and astronomy. Frank had a great sense of humor - often displayed through his collection of unique ties, and the occasional treasure hunt. He enjoyed collecting ships and globes, and displayed them in his home office. Frank completed his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electro-Optics at University of Houston - Clear Lake, within one year of each other. He was a nationally recognized expert for his work for the Department of Defense and Intelligence Community. A natural leader with a keen mind, his problem solving skills brought him great success and admiration as an Engineering Fellow at Raytheon. For nearly two decades, his innate ability for concept development to create innovative solutions to complex problems led to numerous awards - including a National Treasure Citation, a National Intelligence Award, and many others. Frank is survived by his wife of 30 years, Jacquelyn Kay Franceschetti; his parents, S. Frank and Angela Franceschetti; sister, Brenda Zeoli (Jim) of Florida; brother, Steven Franceschetti of New York; nephew, Jeffrey Zeoli of North Carolina; and many other family members and close friends. Frank's family will receive friends from 6:00-8:00 p.m. Monday, October 25, 2021 at Found and Sons Funeral Chapel, 10719 Courthouse Road, Fredericksburg. A funeral mass will be said at 11:00 a.m. Tuesday, October 26, 2021 in the funeral home chapel. In lieu of flowers, Frank's family requests that expressions of sympathy take the form of donations to the Purrs &amp;  Whiskers Inc. Cat Rescue in Stafford, Virginia. </p>

    <h4>Benefits Administrator Change</h4>
    <p>This info was posted on our Facebook group.</p>
    <p>As part of continuing changes from the merger, RTX is changing the benefits administrator to Alight. This change will impact retirees as well as current employees. Current employees have already received information on the changes because their enrollment period starts soon. Retirees are supposed to start getting information in November. The retiree enrollment period will be Nov. 15-24. It appears likely that the insurance providers will be changing but they aren't releasing any details for retirees until November,</p>
    <p>Alight has a benefits "Gateway" website that will be used for enrollment and benefits administration. The information coming in November is supposed to have details on setting up an account. I got a link to instructions for setting up an account from a current employee <a href="https://rtxhealthyyou.com/enrollment-2">https://rtxhealthyyou.com/enrollment-2"</a> . The instructions indicate to go to a <a href="www.yourtotalrewards.com/rtx">www.yourtotalrewards.com/rtx</a> and select "New user?". I decided to try it out. The "New user?" selection links to a couple of identifying questions and then steps you through the account setup. It recognized me (I'm a retiree) and I was able to set up my account. All I could do at this point was setup my profile and preferences. I also used an online chat feature to talk with a benefits representative and find out additional details about benefits changes and enrollment for retirees will not be available until early November. They had my old employee email address in my profile and I had to call Alight to get that corrected (800-243-8135).</p>

    <p>It's my understanding that we should continue to use the current benefits website for the rest of 2021. Alight will handle 2022 benefits enrollment and will take over when the changes go into effect at the beginning of 2022</p>

    <p>RTX is also moving the 401K administration from Fidelity to Alight. The 401K change to Alight will not impact you if you've rolled over your 401K to personal IRA(s). It's also my understanding that the Alight change will not impact retirees' Fidelity HSA accounts if you have one.</p>

    <h2 class="h2Head">Stay away from the virus of 2020</h2>


<h2>From Jerry Bryant:</h2>
<h4>JUST A LITTLE HELPFUL INFORMATION.</h4>
<h4>STROKE HAS A NEW INDICATOR </h4>
  <p>They say if you forward this to ten people, you stand a chance of saving one life. Blood Clots/Stroke —They Now Have a Fourth Indicator, The Tongue.</p>
  <p>STROKE: Remember the 1st Three Letters….. S. T. R. STROKE IDENTIFICATION:</p>
  <p>During a BBQ, Jane stumbled and took a little fall — she assured everyone that she was fine (they offered to call paramedics) she said she had just tripped over a brick because of her new shoes. They got her cleaned up and got her a new plate of food. While she appeared a bit shaken up, Jane went about enjoying herself the rest of the evening. Jane’s husband called later telling everyone that his wife had been taken to the hospital — (at 6:00 p.m. Jane passed away). She had suffered a stroke at the BBQ. Had they known how to identify the signs of a stroke, perhaps Jane would be with us today. Some don’t die. They end up in a helpless, hopeless condition instead. It only takes a minute to read this. A neurologist says that if he can get to a stroke victim <span class="danger">within 3 hours</span> he can totally reverse the effects of a stroke…totally. He said the trick was getting a stroke recognized, diagnosed, and then getting the patient medically cared for within 3 hours, which is tough.</p>

  <p>RECOGNIZING A STROKE Thank God for the sense to remember the ‘3’ steps, STR. Read and Learn! Sometimes symptoms of a stroke are difficult to identify. Unfortunately, the lack of awareness spells disaster. The stroke victim may suffer severe brain damage when people nearby fail to recognize the symptoms of a stroke.</p>

  <p>Now doctors say a bystander can recognize a stroke by asking three simple questions. <span class="danger">S* Ask the individual to SMILE. T* Ask the person to TALK and SPEAK A SIMPLE SENTENCE (Coherently) (i.e. Chicken Soup) R* Ask him or her to RAISE BOTH ARMS</span>. If he or she has trouble with ANY ONE of these tasks, call emergency number immediately and describe the symptoms to the dispatcher. <span class="danger">New Sign of a Stroke: Stick out Your Tongue</span>. NOTE: Another ‘sign’ of a stroke is this. Ask the person to ‘stick’ out his tongue. If the tongue is ‘crooked’, if it goes to one side or the other, that is also an indication of a stroke. A cardiologist says if everyone who gets this information sends it to 10 people, you can bet that at least one life will be saved.</p>

    <blockquote>"At 3 months past his surgery, George’s CT scan results were good, no sign of tumors. Everything looked good with his digestive system from the surgery. We thank God for this progress and good report. Thank you all for your thoughts, prayers and support for the past 3 months. Please continue to pray for him as he continues the remainder of his chemotherapy. He has completed three treatments and has nine treatments to go, ending sometime near Thanksgiving"</blockquote>

    <p class="bold">I am so relieved to say we have no reported virus cases in our group. Let’s keep it that way and take this seriously! If you feel sick, please isolate until you know what’s wrong. If you need anything, and that goes for everyone, reach out through email, Facebook, phone. We are in this together.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Chris Reynolds:  </span>Had her hip replacement surgery March 16th. Here is her latest update from Facebook dated April 18.</p>
    <blockquote>“Doing pretty good - zero hip pain, but knee replacements will have to be done at some point. At least I can walk again - still very cautious about walking on uneven surfaces and going up and down curbs, etc. Not sure that's going to improve much until knees are done! Thrilled with hip replacement, though.”</blockquote>

    <p><span class="bold">George Carlsness: </span>Update on George from Joanne’s Facebook post:</p>
    <p>I want to thank you all so much for your thoughts and concern and especially your prayers. George has had a very tough week but turned a corner on Friday and started feeling a lot better on Saturday and today he sounds more like himself. It takes time for all the organs to wake up after such a lengthy surgery and to start performing as they need to. Meanwhile there’s lots of difficult issues that he has to deal with. Most of the tubes and the catheter were removed on Friday afternoon and he was able to rest better after that. He is much better now and hopefully will get to come home by Tuesday. We are so grateful to God for his healing power that has brought George this far.  </p>
    <p>We learned on Friday that the type of cancer he has is Ampullary carcinoma, the origin of the cancer. The ampullarf is the very end of the bile duct where it goes into the duodenum. The tumor was approximately 1 inch. It was removed of course when he had the other organs removed at the same time. They did discover that the cancer cells had traveled to two lymph nodes. This means that he will require chemotherapy and possibly radiation when he has healed enough, possibly 4 to 6 weeks from now. We would’ve loved, of course, to have heard otherwise but we trust that God is with us every step of the way as he has been. And we know he will provide all that we need. Please pray for continued healing and strength for the next few months as George begins chemotherapy. being apart during this very difficult surgery has been probably the hardest part for both of us. I look so forward to him coming home./p>
    <p>He sends his gratitude to everyone for your prayers and for your well wishes.</p>
    <p>Dear friends and family: update on George since leaving the hospital:</p>
    <p>George came home on Saturday and he is doing very well. He is eating well and seems to be digesting everything well. He gets tired easily but with rest he comes back and is ready to be up again. We went to the doctor today and got a good report. He said that he is doing about how he should be doing at this stage of recovery. He was able to get one drain tube removed. Still waiting for the second one. We meet with the doctor again next week and on the same day we will meet with the medical oncologist regarding chemotherapy. We are so thankful for the progress he is making. We know God is answering many prayers. Thank you so very much for your prayers and your love and support</p>

<h4 class="h4Head">Millie Martin</h4>
    <h4 class="h4Head">December 1940 – November 2019</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/MillieMartin.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Tyler, Texas - Mildred Mae Martin, 78, a long-time resident of Van, Texas, died Friday, November 1st at The Heights of Tyler.</p>
    <p> Mildred Mae Martin (Simpson/Irvin) was born December 29, 1940 in Caney, Oklahoma to the late William Green Simpson and Emma Lois Brister Simpson. She is preceded in death by her brothers, Roger Dale Simpson, Billy Ray Simpson, Harvey Simpson, Nathan Simpson, Watus Simpson and AB Simpson; and former husband, Arvle Andrew Irvin.</p>
    <p>   After attending Abernathy High School, Ms. Martin worked her way through the ranks of type-setting and publishing which included several newspapers. She very quickly mastered expert skills in copy editing and data entry; which ultimately lead to her job at Raytheon E-Systems Inc., Aerospace &amp; Defense for most of her long career. In that position she held a position with the highest civilian government clearance due to the sensitivities of her assignments. It took her on several assignments around the world, including Australia and England. She relished the travel opportunities and made many, many friends along the way. Millie, as she is most known by, was awarded several high honors of excellence for her outstanding work, which she truly loved.</p>
    <p>Even though Millie enjoyed her work and travels, nothing compared to her love and devotion to her family here at home. She was very kind-hearted, never met a stranger, and was extremely generous to all. One of her favorite things to do was to prepare a big Thanksgiving meal every year for her entire family and their friends - her dressing was a tradition. When Millie wasn’t working, or helping someone - she loved to go to garage sales. She always had an eye for things that could be useful to someone she knew.</p>
    <p>Survivors include her two children, Greg Irvin and wife, B. J. of Ben Wheeler and Cheryl Farquhar and husband, Ross of Van; stepdaughters, Susan Herring of Clarksville; Pam Worsham and husband Robert of San Antonio; Gail Crider of Coleman; stepson, Allen Martin of Fruitvale; sister, Fadre Simpson of Murchison; brothers, Floyd Simpson of Dallas and Doug Simpson and wife, Diane of San Antonio; three grandchildren, Rhiannon Sibley and husband, Johnathan of Ben Wheeler; Christopher Farquhar and wife, Brittany of Ben Wheeler; and Nick Sacerdote of Cleburne; former husband, Paul Martin of Van; and numerous great-grandchildren.</p>
    <p>If desired, memorials can be made in her memory to the American Diabetes Association. </p>

    <p><span class="bold">Chris Williamson  </span>MRI update; went fine today - even had to go head first into the thing for the lumbar/spinal MRI. Hip MRI with injection was nice because there's a numbing agent in there so gives some pain relief for a bit. For some reason, the "tube" doesn't bother me because I know I'm not really trapped in there so claustrophobia doesn't set in and my eyes are closed anyway. It's trying to be still and the weird noises that cause more issues for me. Made appointment with surgeon for follow-up and MRI results and whether I'm a candidate for the tendon repair - first available appointment is DECEMBER FREAKING 30TH!!! Going to try and talk to his PA and/or see if I can get a referral to another doctor - that is totally outrageous to wait another two and a half months to even find out what the plan is or if I can be "fixed" and live a normal life again. Really feeling very, very annoyed! I've never had any major health issues so having to deal with this nonsense is a whole new experience for me</p>

Saw the PA for the hip specialist this morning; my tendon tear is more complicated than normal due to the amount of retraction (assume this has been doing on for a long time, but finally started having the really painful symptoms). Also have some hip abnormalities that will make surgery more complicated if even possible - long and painful rehab. I'm going on October 7 for a very detailed MRI of the hip with the dye injection and also an MRI of my lumbar area. Once those are done, I will see the specialist and see what options are available. PA said it may be a right hip replacement will give me more mobility and physical therapy to try and improve the left hip with the tendon tear if surgery is not an option. I just want my life back  :(.</p>

    <p>  SLAUGHTER, Gene Gene Slaughter, 77, passed away Wednesday, July 31 from pneumonia. Gene loved his family and his friends that he considered family. He loved New Mexico, Colorado, mountains and rivers. He loved cats and all small animals. He will be remembered as a quiet soul, who could always be depended on to be there and to help when needed. Gene was born to Willie "Buck" Slaughter and Dorothy Wells in Shiloh, Texas. While Texas-born, Gene grew up mostly in New Mexico and called Aztec, NM his home. After serving proudly in the U.S. Air Force, Gene moved to Plano, Tx. Gene and Nannette Daly married in 1969 and happily bickered daily for almost 40 years until she predeceased him in 2009.</p>
    <p>Gene spent almost his entire career at LTV/E-Systems/Raytheon where he was an electrical engineer. After retirement, he and Nannette moved back to Aztec, NM where they loved gardening, traveling through the Colorado mountains, and watching wildlife. After 15 happy years in New Mexico, the lure of Texas and grandkids called and Gene and Nannette moved back to Kaufman, Tx where they both resided until their passings. Gene was a founding member of the North Texas Antique Tractor and Engine Club. He was also a long-time member of the E-Systems Retirees Club. Gene was predeceased by his parents and his sister Bette Perry. </p>
    <p>  He is survived by his sisters Ginger Taylor and Kathy Ellison and his brother Bob Sheppard. He is also survived by two daughters, Bonita Doyle and Judge Gena Slaughter and her husband, Richard Faulkner; grandchildren Beau, Mason, Evangeline and Grayson; and great-grandchildren Jackson, Harrison and Lyon. Gene is also survived by his family of choice, including Richard and Brenda Gray, Tanya Truitt, Michael Truitt and the entire Truitt family. </p>
    <p>A memorial service was held on Sunday, August 11, 2019 at 4:00 p.m. at the Kaufman County Cowboy Church, 5970 State Hwy 243, Kaufman. As he wished, Gene was cremated; part of his ashes were interred with his wife Nannette in a private service and the remainder will be scattered at a later time over two of his favorite places - Wolf Creek Pass and Engineer Pass in the mountains of southern Colorado. In lieu of flowers, please consider donating to the Dallas Cat Lady rescue group, dallascatlady.org or his place of worship, the Kaufman County Cowboy Church, kaufmancountycowboychurch.org.</p>

<article>
<h4>Raytheon to merge with United Technologies</h4>
<p>New name will be Raytheon Technologies Corporation</p>
<p>Commentary: I never heard back from Earl Munns. I mentioned the retirees’ concerns to my CPA who happens to be the CPA who was E-Systems’ CPA at the time of the Rabbi Trust formation which governs the benefits we receive. This type of trust is protected from takeovers whether hostile or not. A question was raised asking “What happens to the annuity/trust funds after the last beneficiary passes away?” I will try to get the answer to this question.</p>

<h4 class="h4Head">Charlene Gast</h4>
<h4 class="h4Head">January. 24, 1938 - June 16, 2019</h4>

    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/CharleneGast.png"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Charlene Rock Gast, 81 years old, of Caddo Mills, Texas, passed away June 16, 2019, after another difficult battle with pneumonia. She was born January 24, 1938, in Samson, Alabama to Charlie and Annie Rock. Services for Charlene are scheduled for 4 p.m. Friday, June 21, 2019, at County Line Baptist Church, Point, with Bro. Wayne Darty officiating. Cremation arrangements are under the direction of Bartley’s Funeral Home, Lone Oak. </p>

    <p>Charlene graduated from Samson High School in 1956, where she was an honor student, captain of the varsity cheerleading squad and senior homecoming queen. After high school she moved to Auburndale, FL, where she married Wesley Thompson and started a family with their two children, Lyndon and Terri. After their parting of ways, Charlene met and married the true love of her life, Robert (Bob) Gast in 1965. They spent the majority of their years in Loveland, Ohio where she worked at Procter and Gamble and enjoyed block parties, camping and time spent with all of her friends in Pheasant Hills. She was a member at Mason Baptist Church in Mason, Ohio and served faithfully teaching Sunday school, worked with the youth group every Wednesday night and volunteered every year on mission trips. She was an annual volunteer at the Billy Graham Evangelism Conference in Cincinnati and served the elderly who were homebound and in nursing homes. They moved to Richardson, Texas in 1984, to be closer to their children and first grandchild, Shawn. She worked as an Executive Assistant at E-Systems until 1992 when she began her successful career as a real estate agent until she retired in 2008 and relocated to Caddo Mills, TX to live closer to her daughter and her most beloved “angel”, Mackenzie, who was the highlight and total joy of Charlene’s life. She had a love for travel only exceeded by her love for her family. The highlight of each day was talking and laughing on the phone with her brother and best friend, Dovel. She relished any opportunity to speak with or see her grandchildren and great-grandchildren who lovingly called her “G.G.” Her last day was spent with her son-in law Alan, whom she adored, her dear brother Dovel and sister-in-law Judy, her nephew Jason and his wife Nancy standing at her bedside. She passed away peacefully with both hands held by the two people who loved her the most, her daughter and her husband and soulmate of 54 years, both who will miss her more with each passing day until reunited again with our Lord and Savior in Heaven.</p>

    <p>Charlene is survived by her beloved husband, Robert Gast of Caddo Mills; son, Lyndon and Dawn Pemberton of Lucas, TX; daughter, Terri and Alan Schonfeld of Lone Oak, TX; brother, Dovel and Judy Rock of Tuscaloosa, AL; ten grandchildren, Shawn and Tina Mansour of Batavia, OH; Bryan and Lindsey Piccola of Frisco, TX; Mackenzie Mansour of Lone Oak, TX, Austin Schonfeld of Round Rock, TX, Chloe Schonfeld of Fletcher, NC; Wesley and Sas Thompson of Fort Collins, CO; Moriah Thompson and Brock Spratlen of Houston, TX; Colten and Michelle Thompson of Houston, TX, Alison and Shawn Ashmore of Dallas, TX; Andrea and Russell Johnson of Oceanside, CA; three nephews, Stacy, Warren and Jason Rock; nine great-grandchildren, Alexia, Alanna and Shawn Carter Mansour; Finley, Aria and Shiloh Thompson; Dorothy Russell; Bailey and Emory Piccola.</p>

<h4 class="h4Head">Doris Parker Pettigrew</h4>
<h4 class="h4Head">May 1923 - April 2019</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/DorisPettigrew.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>PETTIGREW, Doris Laverne Wesson Parker Doris Laverne Pettigrew, of Austin, Texas passed away on Easter Sunday, April 21, 2019 at the age of 95. Doris, aka Mama, began her journey through life on May 7, 1923 in Bardwell, Texas as the youngest daughter of Zula and James Wesson. She, along with her siblings, Claude and Dorothy, lived on a farm and, in Mama's words "enjoyed a comfortable life". Her father owned one of the first tractors in the area and they had tenants to help work the land and help their mother. James Wesson died in 1929 and the Wesson family moved to Boyce, Texas to live with Zula's widowed mother as the Great Depression of the 1930's settled in.</p>
    <p>As Mama wrote later in a college assignment, "growing up in the Depression, none of us went beyond high school. But we inherited from our father commitment, discipline and the drive to succeed." And succeed she did. After graduating high school in Waxahachie, she attended Metropolitan Business School in Dallas in 1945 and night classes at El Centro Community College in 1968. In 1946 Doris joined TEMCO, an aircraft manufacturing company that eventually became E-Systems. She began her career as a stenographer, then secretary and with a succession of promotions to estimator, senior cost analyst and contract administrator followed. While working for E-Systems, Doris was given the opportunity to attend Southern Methodist University in Dallas culminating in the award of a Master's Degree in Business Administration in 1981. After 42 years with E-Systems, she retired in 1988.</p>
    <p>In 1946, Doris married Joseph Seth Parker in Dallas and, to that union, daughters Cynthia Sue and Darla Jo, joined the Parker family. After 50 years together, Joe passed away in 1996. Mama always stayed close to the E-Systems family and eventually began dating her former colleague, Virgil Pettigrew. After several years of courting, Doris and Virgil were married in Gun Barrel City, Texas in 2005. They enjoyed dining out and dancing, gardening and travel adventures with the extended Pettigrew family. Unfortunately, two years later, Virgil succumbed to cancer in 2007. </p>
    <p>Mama remained in Dallas for some time and finally moved to the Austin area in 2008 near her daughter, Darla. While living in Austin in Brookdale at Gaines Ranch, she made many friends and acquaintances and enjoyed the many and varied activities that were offered. Between tai chi, watercolor painting, pottery, crafting and dancing, Doris maintained an active and busy schedule. But her real passion was shopping! </p>
    <p>Her brother, Claude Wesson, and sister, Dorothy Wesson Munn and Virgil's son, Hal, predeceased Doris. She is survived by daughter, Cindy and son in law Martin Polluconi, grandson, Brandon, daughter Darla Buckner, and former son in law Roy Buckner, whom Doris loved so dearly, as her own son. Roy was always by her side, at the ready, to help with any and everything she needed. Also survived by dearly loved members of the Pettigrew family, Virgil's children, Karla, Mary, Hal's wife, Peggy and Barry Austin. Special thanks are accorded to the many fine folks at Brookdale at Gaines Ranch who went out of their way to keep Mama happy and comfortable in her golden years. For those wishing to do so, donations to the charity of your choice in Doris' name would be very much appreciated. Doris herself was very active in supporting Alzheimer causes.</p>

<h4>Raytheon to merge with United Technologies</h4>

<p>Commentary: I am planning on trying to contact Earl Munns or another in the know person who might have been around when the E-Systems annuity/pension benefit was created. Hopes are that there is a document outlining the E-Systems annuity and any information about it’s creation and long term protection from mergers, take overs, etc.</p>

<h3>Deaths</h3>

<h4 class="h4Head">DoloresHowle-German</h4>
<h4 class="h4Head">June 6, 1934 - April 26, 2019</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/DoloresHowle-German.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Dolores Howle-German was born June 6, 1934 and passed away into the arms of our Lord and Savior on April 28, 2019. She is survived by her husband, Dale M. German; daughter, Noreen Howle Scruggs and husband Sam Scruggs, and daughter, Melinda Howle; sister, Linda Kunkel Vineyard and husband Howell “Pepper” Vineyard; brother, Marvin Kunkel and wife Lavon Kunkel, along with many nieces, nephews (who referred to her as “Aunt Sissy”), cousins and in-laws. She was preceded in passing by her first husband, Norris Howle; sister, Barbara Kunkel Satterwhite and husband Brad Satterwhite; father and mother, Marvin E. and Agnes Fields Kunkel; and stepmother, Nora Kunkel.</p>

    <p>Dolores was born at home, the second of four children, in Laird Hill near Kilgore, Texas. As the daughter of an oil field worker and homemaker, her childhood was spent moving from town to town throughout Texas. Eventually, her family settled in Quitman, Texas where she graduated from high school. Soon thereafter, she met her first love, Norris Howle, also from Quitman. They married while Norris was in the Navy, later moved to Garland, Texas and raised two daughters, Noreen and Melinda. They remained married until Norris’s death in 1979. A few years later, she met the second love of her life, Dale German, while out dancing. After a long courtship, they married in 1997 and shared a wonderfully long and happy life.</p>

    <p>Dolores had many hobbies and pastimes she loved to share with family and friends. She loved arts and crafts, gardening and reading and traveling around the world. She was very involved with friends and family. At church, she always took the time for both bible study and volunteer work, including the creation of a funeral care team at Fellowship Dallas. She was a foodie who loved to cook, and her family and friends will certainly miss her wonderful meals. She was also a great friend to animals and loved her cats.</p>

    <p>Some of the things we remember most about Dolores are the traits that made her such a wonderful mother and friend. She was kind, loving, generous, and compassionate; a genuinely fun woman who loved life and was always open to learning new things. She had a warm, genuine smile and a kind word for everyone she met. Many considered Dolores one of a kind. With a supernatural faith, she fully trusted in God until her last breath. We are blessed and grateful, beyond measure, to have been a part of her life. Beyond a doubt, hers was a life well lived and a Godly race well run.</p>

    <p>In October 2011, Dolores suffered a massive stroke. Since then, Dale has been by her side every day. Now, we say goodbye to our beloved wife and mother. We know she is rejoicing in Heaven, with her Lord and Savior, reunited with loved ones and awaiting our arrival.</p>

    <p class="bold">Dolores supervised Document Control in Building 580, E-Systems/Raytheon.</p>

<h4 class="h4Head">Judy McKelvy Broom</h4>
<h4 class="h4Head">July 1943 - April 2019</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/JudyBroom.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Judy was born to the late John and Pauline McKelvy, July 26, 1943, in Atlanta, Texas. Judy graduated from Pasadena (Texas) High School in 1961 and received a double BA in English and Journalism from East Texas State University in 1965. (As East Texas State is now Texas A&M-Commerce, she considered herself an honorary Aggie. Whoop!)</p>
    <p>Judy was particularly proud of working as a technical editor for NASA during all of the Apollo missions. She went on to become proposal coordinator for Rockwell-Collins and E-Systems. She was still working fulltime as a technical editor and writer for L3 ComCept when she passed.</p>
    <p>Judy is survived by daughter, Shonda Kay Purvis (Michael James Tillman); son, Beau Wade Broom (Karen Lynn Miller); grandson, Logan Wade Broom; grandson, Cash Andrew Miller; granddaughter, Blake Lynn Broom; and grandson, Keilan Lane Broom.</p>
    <p>In her spare time, Judy loved doting on her grandchildren, loved going to movies and musicals (Rent and Hamilton were particular favorites), enjoyed texting her daughter in Scotland, watched her favorite television programs (pretty sure she is disappointed to not see how The Big Bang Theory ends), and read voraciously (novels, cookbooks, history, pretty much everything).</p>
    <p>Judy is also preceded in death by sister, Cynthia Ann Chapman. </p>
    <p>In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made to help with the education of Judy's grandson, Logan. It had been her joy to be his guardian for the last several years. To make a donation, please write to loganbroomeducationfund@gmail.com in order to receive information. </p>

Not really in pain and around noon therapist came with a walker so she could start therapy. They plan for her to be in the hospital a few days (however long that is) and then off to rehab!

    <p>Forest M. Cummings, loving husband, father, uncle, grandfather, great grandfather and friend passed away peacefully at his home in Corinth on March 16. He was 90 years old. A resident of Richardson, Texas, for 54 years, he moved to Corinth in 2016 so he could live close to his wife of 68 years after she suffered a stroke and to be nearer his son and daughter-in-law in Denton.</p>
    <p>He was born in Crawfordsville, Ind., on January 23, 1929, the only child of Marshall and Ruth Cummings. Following his graduation from high school in 1947, he proudly served in the U.S Navy for three years. He traveled the world while serving his country and also became interested in radio technology. After his honorable discharge from the Navy, he attended Purdue University and received his degree in electrical engineering.</p>

He requested a transfer to the company’s offices in Richardson in 1962 and moved his family to Texas that summer. He later worked as a project engineer for Rockwell International and E-Systems. For most of his adult life, he was also an active ham radio enthusiast.</p>
    <p>He was preceded in death by his parents and son, Mike.</p>
    <p>He is survived by his wife, Sue and son Randy (Vicki) of Denton. His step-grandchildren include Ryan Appleton (Stacey), Ross Appleton (Heather) and Lindsay Cavanaugh (Tom), all of Denton. He is also survived by seven great-grandchildren as well as niece Marla Gladwin and nephew Scott Reg, den, both of North Little Rock, Ark., and nephew Mark Redden of Safe Harbor, Fla.</p>
    <p>The family would also like to express its heartfelt appreciation and gratitude to the wonderful staffs at Autumn Oaks of Corinth and the El Dorado Retirement community in Richardson for the love, support and friendship they provided him the last six and a half years.</p>

<h4>Historical Marker Update:</h4>

    <p>The process for acquiring a historical marker is quite involved and not a sure thing. Therefore, I submit another idea. Terry Gaus came up with this idea. There are three bus stops that are in front of the 1200 S. Jupiter Garland location. If there is enough interest, a shelter/bench could be installed at one of them with a short, historical narration of the site. Looks like it would cost around $2,000 and up depending on the style. The metal style bench is more expensive and a separate plaque would need to be attached. Of course, we need to find out if DART would allow this. Terry volunteered to contact the former mayor of Garland, Bob Day, who is also on the DART Board. Maybe we could get some inside pull.</p>

    <h4 class="h4Head">Eldon Sparkman</h4>
    <h4 class="h4Head">April 1933 - March 2019</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/EldonSparkman.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Eldon Sparkman, age 85, passed peacefully into heaven on Thursday, March 21, surrounded by a circle of family. He was born in Bristol, Texas to Mack and Ila (Parker) Sparkman on April 13, 1933, and lived his entire life in the Bristol community he loved.</p>
    <p>Eldon married Peggy Pratt on September 2, 1952, and began a loving marriage that lasted sixty-six years. Eldon adored and bragged about his “Peggy Sue,” and loved to tell others (especially his grandchildren) about their many years together and his hopes that all family marriages would be equally enduring.</p>
    <p>After graduating from Ferris High School in 1952, Eldon enlisted in the Air Force. He was stationed in Biloxi, Mississippi for four years and worked as a math instructor at the Air Force base. He and Peggy cherished the memories they made and the adventures they shared in Biloxi, returning often to vacation there. And all who knew Eldon well remember how much he loved talking about Biloxi. In fact, close friends and family referred to Biloxi as “the B word,” meaning, “Don’t mention ‘the B word’ unless you want to hear another long story about Biloxi.”</p>
    <p>After military service, Eldon and Peggy returned to Bristol where they raised their three children: Ricky, Cindy, and Tim. Eldon instilled a strong work ethic in his children by example, being employed for thirty-five years at E-Systems in Garland while also raising cattle, producing hay, and briefly farming with his brother, Jack.</p>

<h4>Historical Marker Update:</h4>

    <p>TThe process for acquiring a historical marker is quite involved and not a sure thing. Therefore, I submit another idea. Terry Gaus came up with this idea. There are three bus stops that are in front of the 1200 S. Jupiter Garland location. If there is enough interest, a shelter/bench could be installed at one of them with a short, historical narration of the site. Looks like it would cost around $2,000 and up depending on the style. The metal style bench is more expensive and a separate plaque would need to be attached. Of course, we need to find out if DART would allow this. Terry volunteered to contact the former mayor of Garland, Bob Day, who is also on the DART Board. Maybe we could get some inside pull.</p>

I have been going thru neurology tests., heart tests, and lung tests……Main thing that’s shown up so far is back and neck problems which have been causing hand numbness and inability to walk for short periods.

<h3>Deaths</h3>

<h4 class="h4Head">Annn Bryant</h4>
<h4 class="h4Head">April 1938 - February 2019</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/AnnBryant.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>From Jerry, Ann’s husband and ESY-RTN retiree.</p> <br>
    <p>I lost my wife, Ann Bryant, this morning, Sunday, 24 February 2019, in Garland, Texas.</p>
    <p>Ann was 80 years old and was born on a Friday, the 15th of April, 1938 in Jackson, Mississippi.</p>
    <p>Ann and I were one of the many E-Systems marriages. In April of 1980 I was walking down the main hallway at work and Ann was walking up. She stopped me at the entrance to the Reception Area and asked if I would like to go to a departmental party that Tech Pubs was having that month to celebrate the April birthdays in the department. Hers was one of them. I made a beautiful first impression. I said, “Uh, can I let you know?” I’m sure she walked off thinking, well so much for that. You see, I was separated at the time and she thought I was divorced. After thinking it over I thought, why not. I liked her and it would be good going to a party. I called her and asked if the offer was still good and she said yes. Lucky for me. I filed for a divorce two weeks later. We have been together now for almost 39 years. </p>
    <p>Ann had never fired a gun in her life until I took her to Target Master across from the plant. Even with hearing protection on, when she first shot a .22 cal. revolver she jumped back about a foot. We worked our way up through various larger calibers until she was shooting the .357 magnum. She was deadly accurate with it. No flinching. No jumping. I was so proud of her.</p>
    <p>Ann was a good woman in so many ways. She was strong in so many ways. She was very good for me.</p>
    <p>Ann started working for E-Systems in 1973 and retired from E-Systems/Raytheon in 2000. Twenty-seven years. She held several jobs, the longest being over Word Processing while in Tech Pubs. At one time she was Vice-President of the Management Club.</p>
    <p>Ann was a very good sport as you can see from some of these pictures. Down deep she was a real ham. Even with all the pain and discomfiture she was telling stories and making others laugh up close to the end. She died from lung cancer even though she never smoked. Her father was a heavy smoker.</p>
    <p>There will be no funeral at this time. Her cremains will be kept at home and buried at Restland in the Garden of Love at a later date. There will be a Celebration of Life at that time. </p>
    <p>“While we are mourning the loss of our friend others are rejoicing to meet him behind the veil.” John Taylor, 1753-1824</p>

He worked at the family furniture store and then took a management position with a local cabinet and construction company. He went on to receive a bachelor’s degree in business from University of Texas at Dallas. Afterwards, he joined E-Systems, which became Raytheon, where he worked for 20 years as part of their Human Resources management team. He was responsible for labor arbitration and negotiations and helped teach and support employees at a US government facility in Alice Springs, Australia.</p>

<h4>Historical Marker Update:</h4>

    <p>The process for acquiring a historical marker is quite involved and not a sure thing. Therefore, I submit another idea. We could have a small plaque made to post wherever the new building owner would allow (if allowed) that would give a sequential history of the property’s ownership from back to the early farming days, circa 1940’s. There are several styles and materials available.</p>

    <p>Even though we are all generous with leaving tips for our very own table hostess, Ms. Cindy, I presented her with a year-end gift of $50 cash from our group. Cindy is always seeing to our dining needs and makes sure our room is reserved and ready for us every month. I know she appreciates us and is happy to be our dedicated hostess.</p>

<h4>Historical Marker Update:</h4>

    <p>The process for acquiring a historical marker is quite involved and not a sure thing. Therefore, I submit another idea. We could have a small plaque made to post wherever the new building owner would allow (if allowed) that would give a sequential history of the property’s ownership from back to the early farming days, circa 1940’s. There are several styles and materials available. Here is a sample of a few. Feedback is appreciated.</p>

    <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>

    <p><span class="bold">Ann Bryant: – From Jerry on Nov. 20th -</span>“Hey, Eileen.  Ann is doing as well as could be expected I guess.  She had a catscan and it showed that the cancer has spread to her spine and breastplate.  I’m concerned about her falling and maybe breaking a bone but she is an independent cuss and doesn’t like to use her walker or cane.  She is very careful in moving around though.  We are on our third Hospice organization.  We just didn’t feel good about the first one and the second one was sort of Mickey Mouse except for their physical therapist.  Ann and I both liked her.  The Hospice we have now doesn’t have a physical therapist but Ann knows what exercises to do.  She will now have a nurse coming twice a week and an aide will come five days a week if we want her but for right now the aide comes on Fridays only, to help Ann bathe.  They do have some kind of volunteer group who will come and sit with Ann when I have to go out and keep her company.  We haven’t tried that yet but it is nice to know.  The new Hospice lady told us there are around 400 Hospices in the DFW area.  Ann’s main problem right now is back pain.  For that she takes hydrocodone, a pain medicine.  It is not immediate but when it does kick in it gives her some relief.  The nights and mornings are the worst times of day.  Once we get up and get settled for the day it is a lot better.  This caregiving is not easy.  I can’t recall ever being this tired in my life.  Stress has a lot to do with it.  Her two daughters were coming by on Saturdays but they realized how tired I am and her youngest daughter now comes Tuesday and Thursday evenings also and is with her for a while.  If fact she is here now.  This gives me time to relax.  Her other daughter lives next door but gets home late every day from work but she stops in a couple times each week.  That is nice. I think Ann has medicine for any eventuality but it is a scary life.</p>

 <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/JeffKoch.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
<p>KOCH JEFFREY WESCOTT KOCH Passed away unexpectedly with his beloved wife by his side on November 3, 2018, after a courageous battle with liposarcoma. He was 55. The son of Janice Park Koch and the late Franklin Wescott Koch, Jeff was born on May 6, 1963, in Plainfield, NJ. He graduated from Warrensburg High School in Warrensburg, Missouri in 1981 and received his Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1985. He was an Eagle Scout and a passionate member of the Boy Scouts of America, serving in multiple positions including District Commissioner for Washington, DC. He was also a member of the Boy Scouts' Tribe of Mic-O-Say organization. In January 2017, Jeff was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management at U.S. Department of Labor. He previously held various appointed positions at the U.S. Department of Labor as well as the White House Office of Management and Budget, during which time he received a letter of commendation from President George W. Bush. Between 1998 and 2002, Jeff served as chief of staff for his friend and fellow Eagle Scout, Rep. Pete Sessions. Prior to his time in Washington D.C., Jeff worked as an engineer at RF Monolithics, Inc. and E-Systems in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Jeff is survived by his wife of seven years, Patty Stolnacker, and his expected daughter, due in January. He is also survived by his mother, Janice Koch, of Rowlett, Texas; his sister, Jennifer Leigh Davenport, with husband Mark and children Bryce and Hannah, of Rockwall, Texas; his brother, Barry Franklin Koch, with wife Claudia and children Lara and Julie, of Ingolstadt, Germany; and his loyal friend, Lincoln. Jeff was an adored husband, son and brother, a beloved friend and confidante, and a tireless volunteer. He was passionate about cycling, engineering, nature, and music. He made a lasting difference to every endeavor he pursued. Jeff brought his engineering acumen and sense of fun to everything he did, providing joy and lasting memories of Halloween haunted houses, Olympic festivities, and epic water slides to his Palisades neighborhood. Memorial services will begin on Friday, November 9, 2018 with a visitation at the Everly Wheatley Funeral Home in Alexandria, Virginia from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., followed by a service on Saturday, November 10, 2018 at 3 p.m. at the Fairlington United Methodist Church in Alexandria, Virginia.

<h3 class="h3Head">October 31, 2018</h3>

    <p><span class="bigP">HOST:</span>	Terry Gaus, in the absence of Eileen Wahlstrom, who was out for foot surgery</p>
    <p><span class="bigP">PRESENT: </span>35</p>

    <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>

    <p><span class="bold">Gary Andrews:</span> is “under the weather” - mentioned by those in attendance - no additional details provided.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Dennis York:</span> provided a rather extensive narrative of his bout from late 2016 through late 2017 with cellulitis and sepsis, which very nearly killed him.  He’s still walking with a cane, nearly 12 months after his “recovery”.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Heather Kelly: </span> Rita Hall’s daughter has completed her chemo treatments and her prognosis looks great!</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Max Lee:</span> Scott Robinson reported that Max has been ill and taking steroids. This is affecting his organs and brain. Max messaged me on Facebook saying that he will be getting a pacemaker soon and is hopeful that most of his issues will go away.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Ann Bryant: </span> Jerry Bryant notified me of Ann’s illness. Here is his description of her illness.</p>
    <p>“Eileen, I would like to clarify Ann’s cancer.  She has had a spot of her left lung for about nine years and it has been noticed several times.  One doctor at one time told her it was nothing to worry about.  In the latest checkup they determined that it was lung cancer and the x-ray showed a small spot on her spine.  The oncologist at Texas Oncology (Presbyterian) prescribed chemo pills for her in the dosage of 20 mg but she was actually given 40 mg pills, double the dose the doctor said.  She took 14 of the pills and had such a severe reaction to them that she had to be taken to emergency at Presbyterian.  She was there for nine days and the hospital doctor told her they had done all they could for her and she was to be sent home to Home Hospice.</p>
    <p>The thing is, Ann was perfectly o.k. until she took the pills.  You would never have known anything was wrong.  The pills knocked her for such a loop and made her so weak.  That’s when the problems began.  She firmly believes that she does not have cancer and will have further x-rays taken later this month or early next month.  We will know then for sure.  </p>
    <p>The Hospice they recommended wanted to bring in everything including the kitchen sink (gouging Medicare?).  Double this, double that, and the bed they brought in was disgusting.  It would not raise or lower and the two sides they furnished for it were abominable.  One would not fit on the bed and the other fit but wobbled and leaned inward.  Plus the painting on it was peeling like crazy.  It was depressing to look at.  I had them pick up everything and bought a nice adjustable bed and what she needs.  She stays very comfortable in the bed and a La-Z-Boy recliner.  And the medicine!  Good grief!  Hospice’s main goal I believe is to keep the patient comfortable and they furnished prescription after prescription.  The Hospice nurse was having her take pills for depression but we found out the hard way that depression medication depletes the body of sodium and that meant another trip to emergency, this time to Baylor/Dallas.  She was there for six days.  Sodium has to be replenished very slowly or it can be fatal. </p>
    <p>We now have another Hospice/Healthcare outfit taking care of her and a nurse comes in once a week and a physical therapist twice a week.  She has a walker and a cane and is slowly able to walk a short distance without using either of them.  She is getting stronger but is really still too weak to do much.  She lost a lot of weight and it is difficult putting it back on because she eats so little, which is her choice.</p>
    <p>I guess the main thing we have learned from this is to watch the medications you take.  But, how do you know, if a medical person is prescribing them?</p>

<h3>Deaths</h3>

<h4 class="h4Head">Donald Bowne</h4>
    <h4 class="h4Head">August 21, 1933 - October 11, 2018 </h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/DonaldBowne.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Donald Bowne was born on August 21,1933 in Cisco, Texas to William Hodges Bowne and Birdie Jones Bowne. He graduated from Moran High School in 1951 and attended Tarelton Junior College, where he was in the Corp and was awarded a medal for being the neatest cadet. Don graduated in 1953 and moved on to Texas A&M University, graduating in the class of '55 with a civil engineering degree. Mr. Bowne spent 21, years working at E-Systems, followed by another 22 years at Vertex Communication Corporation before retiring to spend time enjoying his hobbies of fishing, hunting and playing golf. He was a long-time member and elder at First Christian Church of Kilgore.</p>

    <p>Left to cherish his memory are Peggy, his wife of 62 years; brother, William Kelly Bowne of Austin; daughter and son-in-law Kevin and Gayla Baxter of Kilgore; son and daughter-in-law David and Paula Bowne of Brookfield, Massachusetts; daughter and son-in-law Michael and LaDonna Fasang of Dallas; granddaughters Maci Bowne, Blair Baxter and Madison Fasang; grandsons Mitch Fasang and Max Fasang; and several close cousins.</p>

<h4 class="h4Head">Bobby Wilson Gilpin</h4>
    <h4 class="h4Head">August 2, 1940 – October 6, 2018</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/BobbyGilpin.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Born August 2nd 1940 in Teague, Texas to Fay and Woodrow Gilpin, he is a true son of the state. His Texas roots begin with settlers in the 1820s, and trace through the rich history of The Republic of Texas and its subsequent statehood. His early years were marked by life in several small towns in Texas and Oklahoma as the family moved around to follow the oil boom. After graduating from Corsicana High School in 1958, Bobby attended The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, now known as Texas A&M University. Upon his graduation in 1962 as a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering, he began his career with LTV Electronics in Garland. Over the subsequent decades, while the company’s name and ownership would change, becoming E-Systems, Raytheon E-Systems, and finally Raytheon, Bobby worked within the same organization for his entire career.</p>
    <p>It was at LTV that he met Gloria Cope, with whom he was united in holy matrimony on June 11, 1966. Their union was blessed with two children; Wesley in 1971, and Katherine in 1974.</p>
    <p>After retirement from Raytheon, Bobby attended Dallas Theological Seminary, graduating in 2006 as a Master of Arts in Biblical Studies. It was here that he fell in love with God’s Word, igniting his passion for knowing God, and making Him known. While always a servant of The Lord, this new passion would drive him the remainder of his days, through physical and emotional trials, to share the glory of God and the promise of the Gospel with all he met.</p>
    <p>Preceded in death by his parents and brother Ronny Woodrow Gilpin, Bobby is survived by his loving wife of 52 years Gloria Gilpin, his children Wesley (Ansley) Gilpin, Katherine (Sam) Renz, and grandchildren Anna and Adalind Gilpin.</p>
    <p>In lieu of flowers please consider a donation, in memory of Bobby, to Dallas Theological Society Dallas Theological Seminary 3909 Swiss Ave Dallas, Texas 75204 </p>

<h4>Historical Marker Update:</h4>

    <p>Darrell Lancaster has contacted the Chair of the Garland Preservation Inc. to investigate the creation of a Historical Marker to be placed at the former E-systems/Raytheon Garland site. He was told that the historical group is only involved with historical buildings not locations.</p>
    <p>Bertha Hall suggested looking at old Garland Daily News articles authored by Sue Watkins. Terry Gaus reminded us that Ron Nielson researched and wrote a document on the topic as well.</p>
    <p>Tom White discovered this website that explains how to apply for an Historical marker. <a href="http://www.thc.texas.gov/preserve/projects-and-programs/state-historical-markers/apply-historical-marker">Clck Here</a></p>

    <p>It appears that the marker we would apply for would be under the “Institutions” category. If anyone would be interested in teaming to develop a request for a marker please email Marv Olson or Eileen Wahlstrom. The first step would be contacting the property owner to obtain written permission to place the marker on site.</p>
    <p>Karen Ebling responded to the group email with advice related to this project. Her husband, Chris, went through the process recently. Here are her comments.</p>

    <p>“My husband Chris (also a RTN retiree) went through the process to apply for a historical marker through the Texas Historical Commission for a building we own. He did it under the “institutions” category too. He learned a lot on the process and said he would be glad to share his experiences and lessons learned.</p>

    <p>Several items to note:</p>

    <p>1. It takes a lot of time and research and writing. While you have a lot of info on the history of the Garland site, it has to be in their format and way of doing things. He spent months and months on the application process.</p>

    <p>2. First application was turned down. They only award so many per year, and he didn’t make the cut. He applied a second year and did a few things differently (he can explain) and was awarded the marker.  One thing he learned is that they limit the number per county per year. So you will compete against others in Dallas County even though the selection team is at a state level. </p>

    <p>3. It’s expensive. You have to pay for the application every time you submit, so he had to pay a fee both years. I forget the amount but it was enough we debated whether to try the second year. THEN after award you have to pay the cost of the marker sign, which we were surprised to find out about after the award. It was $1000 just to have it bronze cast. And there is about a 1 year backlog on getting the sign done before you get it to install. </p>

    <p>Long way to say, this is an awesome idea but first expect a lot of work, maybe some disappointment if it doesn’t get selected, a long process, and some significant cost.</p>

    <p>Hope this helps. If you want to talk to Chris more about details, his email is caebling@gmail.com or phone is 214-912-0637.”</p>

    <h4>NEW ADDITION TO OLD E-SYSTEMS SITE.</h4>
    <p>Canadian Window Manufacturer Expanding to U.S. with Significant Investment in Garland </p>
    <p>Garland has approved a deal with Canada's Quest Window Systems to open the company's first U.S. manufacturing and distribution facility early next year. Anchoring the southern end of the city's new Jupiter Miller Business Park, Quest USA, Inc. will occupy 329,000 square feet of industrial flex space currently under construction at 1720 South Jupiter Road. </p>
    <p>Financially, Quest will invest over $12 million in machinery and equipment and the facility is anticipated to operate with a $5 million rolling inventory. Once fully staffed, the operation will employ over 320 new full-time positions with an anticipated annual payroll of approximately $12 million…..</p>
    <p>….Quest's newest facility is a part of the 110-acre former Raytheon campus that recently underwent redevelopment. As part of that reinvestment effort, Langford Property Company demolished over 750,000 square feet of outdated vertical space and constructed three LEED-certified buildings totaling over 800,000 square feet of new industrial flex space. Quest will solely occupy the largest of the three buildings in the new Jupiter Miller Business Park. Several other companies, including Nutribiotech USA, Southeastern Freight Lines and Ricky Rockets have developed adjacent to this exciting center of industrial reinvestment in Garland</p>

    <h4>Want to work for Raytheon Again?</h4>
    <h4>Provided by Elaine Pettit</h4>
    <p class="centerP">Association of Raytheon Retirees<br>
    PO Box 365<br>
    Marlborough, MA 01752<br>
    www.raytheonretirees.org
    </p>

    <p class="right">August 27, 2018</p>

    <p>Dear Elaine,</p>
    <p>As you may have heard, Raytheon has seen an increase in their bookings and is in the process of a significant push to hire additional engineers in the current calendar year. In keeping with that, there is an increased interest in bringing back retirees to provide additional staffing.</p>

    <p>As a returning retiree, you would actually be “hired” by a third party consulting firm so that there would be no impact to your pension.</p>

    <p>As a first step, we will be providing Raytheon a list of interested retirees with some basic information. This list would then be sent to the various hiring managers and where there is interest, they would follow up with the retiree directly. Note that not all retirees will be contacted.</p>

    <p>If you are interested in being considered, please send us an email (or click the button below) that includes the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Name, address, telephone and email contact information</li>

        <li>Description of your specific interest – what type of work, locations that you are willing to work at (including preference), number of hours per week you are willing to work (on average). (Note that Raytheon has a limit of 975 hours per calendar year, which roughly corresponds to half time – however, that can be full time for 6 months or any combination)</li>

        <li>Previous position at Raytheon and summary of most recent experience there as well as other relevant experience since leaving Raytheon.  Please include names of Raytheon personnel that you worked with.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For those who wish to do so, you can search existing job postings and reference these postings by requisition number. This is optional – the link to the postings is https://jobs.raytheon.com.</p>

    <p>There is particular interest in power systems, digital signal processing, and cybersecurity.</p>

    <p>Please provide your response (if any) soon.</p>
    <p>Thank you,<br>
The Association of Raytheon Retirees Board of Directors</p>

Encouraging and sweet, Sharon adored being a “Mommaw” to her grandchildren and great-grandchildren and was best friends with her daughter, Christy. She was a very independent, kind-hearted, giving, and organized person and was a teacher of many things. Sharon could bake a mean chocolate pie, cherry cheese pie, and pot roast. You could guarantee that she never left the house without her makeup on and her hair fixed just right. She had the most beautiful white hair and got compliments almost every single day from at least one person. Sharon was a loving mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother and will be tremendously missed by everyone whose lives she touched.</p>

<p>Sharon is survived by her loving daughter: Christy Peoples and husband Deryl; granddaughter: Ashley Gandy and husband Jake; grandson: Taylor Gheen and wife Taryn; step grandchildren: Deryl Peoples, Jr., Jeniffer Davis and Ashley Cantrell; great-grandchildren: Case Gandy, Dylan Peoples, Nicolas Peoples, Jon Jon Peoples, Reagan Thomas, Caleb Peoples, Bryce Berry, and Brody Cantrell; and brother: Gene Speight and wife Sandy; along with a host of loving relatives and dear friends. She was preceded in death by her parents and sister, Charlotte Hyles.</p>

<p>Funeral services will be held 12:00pm Friday, July 20, 2018 at Reflections at Rest Haven Funeral Home – Rockwall Location with Pastor Rick Donaho officiating. Interment will follow at Rest Haven Memorial Park. The family will receive friends Thursday evening at The Gathering at Rest Haven Funeral Home – Rockwall Location from 6:00 to 8:00pm.

    <h4>E-Systems Photo Album - from Gary Smith</h4>
        <p>From Gary Smith:</p>
        <p>“I am scanning a "bunch" of people pictures from work and will be posting them in a photo albums on the E-Systems Retiree Facebook page. Some of these are black and white and some are more recent color photos. Most are award driven. Please announce at the luncheons in the future and on the E-Systems web page (Marv) for people to look for these posted photos if they are interested.</p>
        <p>It will take some time and I plan to post in bunches. So tell folks there will be multiple photo albums. They can get to them by going to the E-Systems' Retirees Facebook page, then looking on the left side for the word "Photos", clicking on the word and then looking for the appropriate album. Unfortunately there is not a name associated with the album but the top photo will be shown. People should be able to figure it out.</p>
        <p>Also I am posting photos of history on the normal area of Facebook posts on the E-Systems' Retirees Facebook page.</p>
        <p>Have fun and please communicate these announcements.</p>

        <h4>E-systems/Raytheon Garland Site Historical Marker</h4>
        <p>Darrell Lancaster has contacted the Chair of the Garland Preservation Inc. to investigate the creation of a Historical Marker to be placed at the former E-systems/Raytheon Garland site. He was told that the historical group is only involved with historical buildings not locations</p>
        <p>Bertha Hall suggested looking at old Garland Daily News articles authored by Sue Watkins. Terry Gaus reminded us that Ron Nielson researched and wrote a document on the topic as well.</p>
        <p>Does anyone have connections to who we would contact about placing an historical marker somewhere on the site?</p>

    <h4 class="h4Head">May 1963-April 2018</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/LisaNorris.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Lisa Anne Norris of Rowlett, TX, passed April 14, 2018, at the age of 54. She was born May 15, 1963, in Dallas to Jack and Linda (Mosshart) Henigan. Lisa was a resident of Rowlett 14 years and a faithful member of Lake Pointe Church. She worked as an accountant for Raytheon and in her free time she loved to be a soccer mom for her sons, spend girl time with her daughter, visit with family and friends, have her feet rubbed by her husband, and gather with her Westwood Shores Bunco Group. Lisa loved her family and friends very much and was loved by them. She will be dearly missed.</p>

    <p>Lisa is survived by her husband of 16 years, David Keith Norris of Rowlett, TX; sons, Justin Price Bailey of Prosper, TX, and Bryce Regan Norris of Rowlett, TX; daughter, Nicole Elizabeth Noble and husband Brandon of Maryville, TN; parents, Jack and Linda Henigan of Garland, TX; brother, David Alan Henigan and wife Catherine, and their daughter Riley Henigan; mother-in-law, Fay Norris of Sulphur, LA; aunt and uncle, Martha and Dan Turner; sister-in-law, Deborah Doan and husband Danny; brothers-in-law, Randy Norris and wife Anne, and Daniel Norris and wife Cysi; aunts and uncle, Janie Beasley, Acie and Helen Jane Henigan; many other loving nieces, nephews and cousins.</p>

    <p>From Dee Ann Cummings on Facebook: I was told that she had cancer in her eye ~5 years ago and that cancer apparently struck again. She only went out on medical leave 2 weeks ago. No one I’ve talked to even knew she was sick. So apparently the cancer had spread extensively and was advanced. That’s all I’ve been able to find out. Soooo sad. Was told she was about 2 years from planning to retire</p>

    <h3>Announcements</h3>

    <p>Dan Parker shared a funny memory about Leon Graham. He remembered a time when Leon was entertaining several “Govies” and when it was time to leave one of the guests gave Leon a $20 bill to pay for his drinks as per the “rule”.  Leon promptly pocketed the money and afterwards reminded his colleagues that it had been happy hour and the drinks were free. At least he eased the “Govie’s” conscience about accepting a gift.</p>

        I’ve had two bypass surgeries, a hip replacement,<br>
        New knees, fought prostate cancer and diabetes,<br>
        I’m half blind, can’t hear anything quieter than a jet engine,<br>
        Take 40 different medicines that make me dizzy, winded,<br>
        and subject to blackouts.<br>
        Have bouts with dementia. Have poor circulation.<br>
        Hardly feel my hands and feet anymore.<br>
        Can’t remember if I’m 85 or 92.<br>

    <p class="info bold bigger">This is pretty important to get to people with Medicare, their families and friends or adult kids who help parents with Medicare Have just gotten word about the newest Medicare scam from  a division within the Better Business Bureau.</p>

    <p class="info bold bigger">Here's what you need to know to protect yourself, family and friends throughout the US. Starting 4/1/18 Medicare will start a year long project to replace all current Medicare cards for beneficiaries to convert to alphanumeric ID numbers. Currently the ID number is your social security number. This is starting to hit the media. </p>

    <p class="info bold bigger">Scammers are opportunistic First of all the new Medicare card will come to you in the mail. You don't need to request it or do anything. It will show up. WHAT'S THE SCAM? Somebody from "MEDICARE " will call to tell you you are getting a new Medicare card. But until it comes you will need a temporary card. Fee for the card is between $5-50 dollars. They want personal information, bank account or credit card so they can process your temporary card. THINGS TO REMEMBER Medicare will never call you unless you ask them to. Medicare does all communications by mail unless you ask them to call. Ditto for anybody saying they "work with Medicare to make sure you get everything you are entitled to" . </p>

    <p class="info bold bigger">Scammer alert HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM THIS ONE? First of all spread the word. Feel free to share these notes. Use your answering machine to screen calls or just don't even answer a number you don't recognize. If it has happened to you or your friends or loved ones and personal info had been given out (happens considerably more often than you think so don't feel bad or stupid ) immediately take action to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

    <p>Andy thoroughly loved programs and movies about the life of Christ. He was a fan of old western movies, musicals, and comedies. He loved all the Rocky movies and would watch them time and time again. Andy was a genius when it came to the New York Times Crossword Puzzles and the app Whirly Word. He enjoyed spending time with his friends and family on Facebook and always spoke his mind. Andy's faith was strong, and he was never afraid to share it with others. He enjoyed playing golf, board games, cards, and dominos with family and friends. Andy loved camping, hiking through the woods, snow skiing, fishing, and gatherings with friends and family. He enjoyed soaking in the hot tub with his wife Andrea and their children and cooking his mother's spaghetti recipe. Andy also enjoyed listening to 60's music as well as music from his parents' era. He was very intelligent, witty, and had a great sense of humor. Andy never met a stranger and was very kind and compassionate to all those who knew him.</p>
    <p>Andy served our country in the Air Force from 1971 through 1975 as a Commercial Artist Illustrator and was awarded the National Defense Service Medal and the Air Force Good Conduct Medal.

    <h3>Announcements</h3>

    <p>We had some discussion about the idea for a bench and/or placard to be installed at the former Garland plant site. More ideas were talked about and John Talbert volunteered to contact a friend in his church who has successfully facilitated the process for getting several historical markers. Not sure where all this is going, but, updates and ideas will be shared. Any suggestions are welcome.</p>

    <h4 class="h4Head">James Crowley</h4>
        <h4 class="h4Head">February 1930 - November 4, 2017</h4>
        <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/JamesCrowley.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
        <p class="bold">E-Systems Corporate Vice President and General Counsel</p>
        <p>James Worthington Crowley of Dallas, Texas passed away on Saturday, November 4, 2017, at the age of 87. Jim was born on February 18, 1930, in Cookeville, Tennessee and was the only child of Worth and Jessie Crowley. The family moved to the Washington DC area in the 1940"s where Jim attended Woodrow Wilson High School and later received his BA and Juris Doctor from George Washington University.</p>
        <p>In 1952, Jim married Laura Bauserman and they had two children, Ken and Cindy. In 1965, Jim and Laura were divorced. Jim married Joyce Ann Goode, and two more children, John and Noelle, were soon added to the growing family.</p>
        <p>In 1969, Jim, Joyce and the two younger children relocated to the Dallas area where he was VP, Corporate Secretary and General Counsel for E-Systems, a major defense contractor. After 13 years of marriage, Jim and Joyce divorced, and Jim subsequently remarried for the last time to Carol Diane Golden. Carol brought along her four children, Laurie, Robert, Gary and Ginger, resulting in an immediate doubling of the Crowley-Golden clan!</p>
        <p>Sadly, Carol passed away in 2014. Jim today is survived by his eight children, James Kenneth and wife Beatriz Crowley, Laura Cynthia Kiser, John Worthington Crowley, Noelle Virginia Crowley, Laurie Golden Dees and husband Ken Dees, Robert James and wife Amy Golden, Gary Brian and wife Carissa Golden, and Ginger Golden Tow and husband Brent Tow; thirteen grandchildren, James Jeffrey Crowley, Katherine Marie Crowley, Jacob Houston Kiser (deceased), Laura Annalise Kiser, Brent Robert Golden, Bryan Hunter Golden, Cody Taylor Golden, Chandler Golden Waite and husband Matt Waite, Conor Golden, Christen Alexandria Crowley, James Colin Dees, Preston Wayne Tow and Chase Golden Tow and one great-granddaughter Blaise Marie Baker. The latest family member will probably need a scorecard when she is old enough to read!</p>
        <p>Jim was a devoted father, an active member of his community and church, a sympathetic listener, and a man of sound judgement. Jim's career was long and varied beginning in underwriting, cartography, and contract administration for Atlantic Research and other government aviation contractors and he was instrumental in facilitating the merger of E-Systems and Raytheon. He was a member of American Society of Corporate Secretaries, the President of the Dallas Regional Group in 1988-89, and National Director 1989-92, National Security Industrial Association, Law Counsel for Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, Omicron Delta Kappa, Alpha Chi Sigma, Pi Sigma Kappa. </p>
        <p>He also was an accomplished musician and played both the French horn and the piano. He also sang in and served as President of the First Baptist Church of Richardson choir for many years. We remember melodies of classical music as Jim played his piano after coming home from the office.</p>
        <p>We remember for many years the enjoyment of watching Jim and his more musically inclined children perform in the annual church Christmas and Easter programs. We remember sleeping on the motorhome, menageries of pets (mainly cats), big family get-togethers, generosity in times of need and stability in times of stress. We remember so much.</p>
        <p>The now silent piano reminds those of us who grew up in Jim"s household of his music, his wisdom, his love, and the father we have lost. Visitation at Restland Memorial Park on Thursday, November 9, 2017, from 5:00 - 8:00 p.m. and a memorial service will be held on November 10, 2017, at 11:00 a.m., also at Restland. Memorial donations may be made in Jim's name to your preferred veteran's groups or animal rescue organizations.</p>

        <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/EdMcCamey.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
        <p>Ed McCamey, of Wills Point, passed away on the evening of November 16, 2017. Ed was born August 19, 1946 in Bethesda, MD to Clifford and Phyllis (Aldrich) McCamey, both of whom preceded him in death.</p>
        <p>Ed grew up in the Dallas area and was a 1964 graduate of Bryan Adams High School and graduated from UT-Dallas with a degree in anthropology. He served honorably in the US Army having been stationed in Europe and achieving the rank of Captain. He was a member of the Toastmasters International for over 46 years as well as Southwest LiveSteam. Ed was a longtime and very active member of Good Shepherd Episcopal Church in Terrell where his devotion to his Lord was evident in his service to the church serving on the Vestry as Senior Warden. He had a love of life and was known for his many and varied interests and hobbies with a special fondness for model trains. Ed also traveled abroad doing research for the National Science Foundation in places like Nepal and South America where he demonstrated and increased his knowledge of anthropology as he studied primitive cultures and their ways of life.</p>

    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/DickDirks.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>DIRKS, Dick Dirks (88) of Plano, Texas, died October 9, 2017 after a short illness. Dick grew up in central rural Illinois and served in the US Navy from 1946 to 1949. Dick and his wife Ruth (Upton), whom he met while attending Northwestern University, celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary in 2012. They had resided in the Dallas area since 1953. Ruth died in early 2013. Dick received a BS in Business Administration from SMU and an MBA from Pepperdine University, earning both degrees while working full-time and raising a family. His successful professional career spanned 36 intriguing years, beginning in 1953 as an electronics systems engineer at Chance Vought Aircraft. He retired in 1989 from its successor, E-Systems, as the Director of Business Planning of the Garland Division. Through the years, Dick was instrumental in expanding many aspects of the company's international business, especially in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Dick also traveled extensively with Ruth throughout the US and Europe. Dick personally restored a dozen vintage automobiles, including a 1930 Model A Ford Coupe and two beautiful red 1965 Mustangs. He was active in the Dallas Model A Ford Club and in local Mustang car clubs. In retirement, he started a collectible toy business, specializing in original Disney and early mechanized toys. His family and friends will long remember Dick's integrity, sense of humor, and large collection of jazzy suspenders. He is survived by his children Susan Dirks (Kent Stevens) of McMinnville, OR; Carol Dirks of Frisco, TX; Mary Winter (Douglas) of Roseburg, OR; and Jean Brazil (Michael) of Mansfield, TX; and grandsons Justin (Crystal), Ryan, and Kevin Brazil. Also surviving are Dick's siblings George, Gert Ross, Dorothy DeBord (Harold), Nancy Aspeitia, Anna Witbeck, and Annetta Tillman, all residing in Illinois. Brothers Albert and Alfred preceded him in death. A memorial service and internment of ashes will be held in Emden, IL, at a later date. Memorial donations may be made to Shriners Hospitals for Children or to the charity of your choice.

    <P class="bigP">Phil Wirth captured a great moment when the E-Systems flag flew one last time at the Garland site. A few days later the poles came down. Phil suggested auctioning the framed picture and Bob White opened the bidding with $25. Jim Lawson upped the bid, via email, to $50. At the luncheon Bob increased his bid to $60 but was quickly outbid by Janis Thompson with an offer of $100. John Talbert jumped in with a raise at $125, but Janis had other plans. She wanted the picture for her brother, Curtis Ritchie, and her winning bid of $150 brought on a round of applause from the group. Congratulations Janis and Curtis!</P>

We spent 4 weeks on the road and visited family in both southern and northern California. When we returned home I left for Colorado spending 3 weeks there.

    <p><span class="bold">Ronda O’Dell </span>Posted on Facebook September 12th - Feeling very optimistic. Met with my oncologist yesterday and he said one more test on the tissue they already have to determine if chemo is needed. He seriously doubts it will be needed, but wants to be sure. I get those results Oct 5. I have an appt. with Radiologist on Sept 20 to get that process setup when the time is right. IF chemo is needed, then chemo is done first, then 5 weeks of radiation then I'll be started on a hormone blocker. Most likely I'll start radiation mid October. My oncologist said the odds of this coming back are less that 5-10%. He was very pleased with my prognosis.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Wayne Weltin by Tim Weltin</span>.  Edited by Darrell Wilhite<br>
    The lifetime journey of my wonderful father, Wayne Weltin, ended last Sunday in Houston. My Dad passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 89 on August 20. He led a remarkable life and leaves a significant legacy. He was born in Millersville, Ohio. Wayne is survived by his wife of 52 years and partner of 57 years, Teresa Weltin, as well two daughters, my sisters Erin & Carol, and two sons including my brother Paul. He is joining his daughter Susan and son Kent in heaven. My father is also survived by nine grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</p>
    <p>Dad was a 20-year veteran of the Air Force. He spent much of his career in military intelligence and had a top secret security clearance. Among other things, he spent many years living in Alaska, part of the time on the Aleutian Islands, monitoring Russian activity. He met my mother while he was serving in the Air Force, while stationed in San Antonio. I videotaped the story of their initial social encounter a few years ago: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDJ05nexSks ">Click here</a>. My Dad spent his second career in marketing, working for a defense contractor, E-Systems Inc., for 28 years.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">FROM MAUREEN DIETRICH</span>. Wayne & Teresa’s Granddaughter.<br>
    My heart is so heavy and the tears are afresh.  My lovely Irish Granny went to heaven yesterday, September 14, 2017 to join her husband, my Grandad (who passed only weeks ago).  I am so thankful for my memories of her beautiful shining eyes, I loved her laugh, and her warm hugs and kisses.  She was so proud of her family; she treasured us grandkids and let everyone know it.  Her pride for her family was written all over her beautiful face.  I already miss you immensely, Teresa, but yes this world was a better place with you in it.  I will continue to do my part to continue your legacy.</p>

<h4>George John Slusarchyk</h4>
    <h4>August 1935 – April 2017</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/GeorgeSlusarchyk.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>George John Slusarchyk, 81, of Galveston, left us on Saturday April 15, 2017 to join his beloved wife, Joan, and his daughter, Mary-Alice, along with family and friends in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
    <p>As the patriarch of our family, George was always ready to help us, to guide us, and to make sure we knew that he loved us. He was always there to listen to whatever we had to say and to share a story or two of his amazing life.</p>
    <p>George was born August 17, 1935 to George and Anna Slusarchyk in Port Jefferson, New York. He achieved a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn in 1958.  During his career of 45 years he was mainly engaged in highly classified Intelligence Programs during the Cold War years.  During George’s time away from work, he was passionate about sailing.  He was the skipper of his Irwin J24 racing sail boat.  Later and to the conclusion of his storied career, George was involved in the installation and testing of state-of-the-art fiber-optical digital data transmission.</p>
    <p>After his retirement in 2000, George and his wife, Joan, retired to Galveston, Texas, where they spent their remaining years exploring the Gulf Coast, getting to know the residents, and hosting many gatherings with family and friends. They loved being together and spending their time enjoying the island life.</p>

<h4>Blaine Keith Newman</h4>
    <h4>August 16, 1963 - July 27, 2017</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/BlaineNewman.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Blaine Keith Newman, age 53, of Garland, TX passed away on Thursday July 27, 2017. Blaine was
    born August 16, 1963 to Barbara Newman and Bill Newman.</p>
    <p>He graduated from Bryan Adams High School in East Dallas in 1981, and earned an Associate's Degree in Computer Science from Eastfield Junior College.</p>
    <p>Blaine was a member of Troop 744 in Dallas, Texas. He earned scouting's highest rank, Eagle Scout. He went on numerous campouts and to summer camp, as well as a high adventure backpacking trip to Philmont in the mountains of northern New Mexico. Blaine went on many trips with his extended family including Disney World and Colorado. One memorable trip was a driving adventure to Las Vegas with his   brother Bret, cousins Kyle and Jill along with his mother and great aunt. It was memorable for many reasons, but one thing that stood out, is that Blaine and Kyle did all the driving even though they were relatively new to driving. Many fun summers and weekends were spent with cousins at "Farissville" at Lake Tawakoni.  Growing up, there were many hours spent with his across-the-street cousins and friends just riding bikes, playing basketball, roaming the neighborhood, and occasionally, fireworks and BB guns were involved.</p>
    <p>Blaine is survived by his mother Barbara Newman; father Bill Newman and step-mother Lydia Newman;  brother Bret Newman and sister-in-law Amy Newman; nephew Tyler Newman, nephew Matt Newman,  Debbie Harbin, Bill Andelman, David Terry Andelman, Laurel Newman, aunt Vicki Newman, uncle Jim  Newman, cousin Kyle Newman and wife Kelly Newman, cousin Alex Newman, cousin Collin Newman, cousin Jill Newman Richardson and husband Delbert Richardson, cousin Allison Richardson and cousin  Blake Richardson.</p>

As a child, Julie and her two sisters were very involved in Mission Friends, Girls in Action and ACT Teens.

<h4>Jackie Thomas</h4>
    <h4>October 4, 1934 - August 05, 2017</h4>
    <img class="img40PercentCenter" src="./photos/JackieThomas.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Jackie Armstrong Thomas, of Terrell, passed away into the presence of her Savior on the morning of August 5, 2017 with her family at her side. Jackie was born October 4, 1934 in Corsicana, Texas to Charlie Joe and Jackie (Jennings) Armstrong, both of whom preceded her in death.</p>
    <p>Jackie grew up in an era that emphasized family devotion, hard work ethic, respect for others and these characteristics shaped her personality to be a perfect Proverbs 31 woman. She was kind, selfless and loving to everyone that she met. Growing up on her family’s farm, Armstrong Dairy Farm, enabled her to develop into a young lady that honored commitments and valued traditions. Jackie graduated from Emhouse High School in 1953 having been voted by the student body as Senior Favorite and Good Citizen. On June 23, 1953, she married the love of her life, Bobby Thomas, and were blessed with two sons, Darrell and Danny. She loved doing for others and Jackie could be counted on to help with baby and wedding showers, birthday celebrations and any get together. She arrived not only with food but with a servant’s heart to help everyone have a great time and her very social personality made an instant friend for life to all who met her. She was a longtime and active member of College Mound UMC and friendships made there were some of her most treasured. She and Bobby enjoyed traveling to many family reunions where Jackie could “catch up” with extended family and share memories that had been made. Always one to enjoy a good visit, she would often be found at all church activities, helping and laughing, as well as going out to eat with Bobby so she could see all her other friends here in Terrell. As devoted as she was to Bobby and her sons, Jackie found a deeper love that is known only to grandmothers and when her grandchildren and then great grandchildren came along, they had her wrapped around their fingers. She supported and encouraged them in all their endeavors so that they would always have a firm foundation of knowing they were cherished by Jackie. She had a way of making everyone she met feel the true joy that she always felt and Jackie will be missed greatly.
    <p>She leaves to continue her legacy of unconditional love her husband of 64 years, Bobby Thomas of Terrell; sons: Darrell Thomas and wife, Sherry, of Royse City, Danny Thomas and wife, Karien, of McKinney; four grandchildren: Dusty Wayne Thomas, Joni Rae Duvall, Jana Lee Thomas and Taylor Dan Thomas; four great grandchildren: Chasity, Conner, Devin, Kaleb Thomas; brother, W.J. “Sonny” Armstrong; sister, Katherine Cameron as well as several nieces, nephews, extended family, church family and a host of other friends. </p>
    <p>For those wishing and to honor Jackie's service to others, memorials may be made to College Mound United Methodist Church, PO Box 793, Terrell, Texas, 75160.</p>
    <p>Jackie worked in Facilities at E-Systems</p>

<h4>James Lee Metze</h4>
    <h4>July 11, 1939 - August 9, 2017</h4>
    <img class="img60PercentCenter" src="./photos/JamesMetze.png"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>James “Jim” Lee Metze, age 78, was born on July 11, 1939 in Tecumseh, Oklahoma. He passed away on August 9, 2017 in Anna, Texas. Jim was the second of four children. His parents, Clyde Marshall Metze, Jr. and Sara Smith Metze, preceded Jim in death as did his elder brother, Clyde Marshall Metze, III.</p>
    <p>Jim grew up in various cities in Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas and graduated from Levelland High School, Levelland, Texas in 1957. He graduated from… Texas Tech University earning both a bachelors and master’s degree in math and physics. Jim loved playing in the band while in high school and college.
    <p>Jim had a passion for music. He played several instruments but loved the trombone and string bass the most. Jim not only played in the marching band, but also played for Sonny West’s rock and roll band and recorded several songs including “Rock-Ola Ruby” and “Sweet Rockin’ Baby”. The band would later open for Buddy Holly and the Crickets. </p>
    <p>After graduating from Texas Tech, Jim moved to Seattle, Washington to work for the Boeing Company. He later returned to Texas where he worked for the LTV Corporation, which became E-Systems (and later bought out by Raytheon).</p>
    <p>Jim’s work at E-Systems was often a mystery among his family members as it involved classified government projects. Jim enjoyed an award- winning career over 30 years. In fact, Jim’s involvement with the flight-automated system used with the Federal Aviation Administration later became an exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C.</p>

    <p>Early last month, the Ninth Annual Senior Awareness Day at the Richardson Civic Center was held.  There were 60 exhibitors available with resources, products, and services geared towards senior citizens as well live acts and entertainment, refreshments, and door prizes.  Hundreds of senior citizens from Richardson, Garland, Sachse, Rowlett, and surrounding communities came out to take advantage of the amazing opportunities to converse with exhibitors and learn more about local resources available.  Many also came to enjoy the entertainment and fun of the morning in the company of other seniors.  Local elected officials from Richardson, Garland, and Rowlett also stopped by the event to meet with constituents and to enjoy the festivities.  Special thanks to the City of Richardson for providing such a great venue for the event, and to all of the wonderful volunteers that made the event possible.  TheTenth Annual Senior Awareness Day will take place in August of 2018 in Garland and I hope to see you there!  </p>

    <p class="bigBold">Announcements</p>

    <p class="bold">We welcomed Mr. Jim Merriman from Medicare and More as a subject matter expert to answer our questions about Medicare. Mr. Merriman has 10 years experience and almost 1,500 clients who have benefited from his Medicare knowledge. Jim was very informative and I know I gained a few tips from his brief visit. He encouraged us to attend one of his free sessions to really dig into the topic. Even (and especially) if you have been on Medicare for a while, he pointed out how the Medicare rules, providers, costs, and even our personal situations change, so revaluating our current Medicare choice is very critical. The schedule can be found on his website at <a href="http://www.medicareandmore.co/" target="_b">www.medicareandmore.co</a>. Currently he offers the free session twice a month in Frisco through November and once a month is Sherman. Most likely, additional sessions will be scheduled for 2018.</p>

    <P class="bigger">THE SECRET'S OUT: COVERT E-SYSTEMS INC. COVETS COMMERCIAL SALES</P>
    <p>By John Mintz October 24, 1994 </p>
    <p>If Big Brother ever took control of the United States, E-Systems Inc. would surely be its prime contractor. Consider:</p>
    <ul>

        <li>E-Systems designs spy satellite gear that can snap photographs of automobile license plates from space and capture electronic communications, from phone calls to rocket telemetry.</li>
        <li>E-Systems software can analyze those spy satellite photos to see if anything has changed -- a Russian tank moved or an Iraqi missile site built -- since the last shots were taken.</li>
        <li>E-Systems can build "electronic fences" to police borders. It helped build one such network of sensors to monitor drug traffickers along the U.S. border with Mexico, and the company says it hopes to build a more sophisticated one for Saudi Arabia.</li>
        <li>And E-Systems hardware can help federal drug enforcement agencies track cocaine planes and tap drug dealers' telephones.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, E-Systems' technologies, part of the central nervous system for the nation's intelligence community, are regarded as brilliant by intelligence agencies and Wall Street.</p>

    <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>
    <p>Johnny Gardner is recovering from a fall off a ladder he had early in May. He had surgery and rehab and is walking with a cane now.
</p>
    <p>Janis Thompson will be having surgery on her aortic valve on June 13th. The valve replacement is scheduled for June 13th using a fairly new procedure where they go through an artery rather than opening the chest. She is very excited that it can be done that way. The recovery is so much faster.</p>
    <p>Dennis York was able to join us for lunch. He told me that he had a very life threatening battle with Cellulitis… a bacterial infection of the skin and tissues beneath the skin. He is walking with a cane now, but, had a rough time with it and could have died if he had not gotten treatment when he did!</p>

    <p>We had some lively discussion related to Medicare, prescriptions, and medical insurance in general at our May meeting.

Several liked the idea and both Max Lee and Jim Lundgren suggested Jim Merriman from Medicare and More as a subject matter expert to speak following our next luncheon meeting. Mr. Merriman has 10 years experience and over 1,500 clients who have benefited from his Medicare knowledge. If you are interested in sticking around after our regular meeting on the 28th please bring your questions and Mr. Merriman will help us understand our options.</p>

    <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>
    <p><span class="bold">Carolyn Gambrell: </span>Saturday 03/25/2017 @ 6PM She was sitting on the side of the bed and fainted falling into the night stand and then the floor. I was in the kitchen preparing our dinner and heard the fall. I rushed into the bedroom and found her unconscious. I tried to awaken her but to no avail. Called 911 and they were here within minutes. She hit her face and forehead on the night stand and was bleeding. EMT's got her awake and off to Lake Point ER. Tests results in ER showed a very low pulse & heart pressure. From ER she was moved to ICU, one on one RN's. Cardiologist was notified and prescribed meds IV. She reacted to the IV meds about 10PM and I went home. 5:50A Sunday nurse called and said come to hospital and said her Heart Dr was on his way. Heart Dr monitored her signs for 2 hours and reported that she was in need of a pace maker and he was trying to get his team together ( Sunday AM ). He reported he wanted to try a med to see if he could get the pulse &amp; heart rate in check, it worked.</p>
    <p>She is on blood thinners and her heart has been over worked so he ordered a heart catheter test to see if her heart was strong enough for the pace maker operation.</p>
    <p>Monday 03/26/2017 AM</p>
    <p>We are waiting for the catheter test scheduled for this afternoon.</p>
    <p>Tuesday 03/28/2017</p>
    <p>The results from her heart catheter test showed her plumbing ( Doctors words ) is good, arteries & valves good, what the test also showed was weak muscles. More tests were performed and the decision was made to implant an ICD = Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator pace maker. This operation is to be performed Thursday, no time set. She needs prayers please.</p>
    <p>Wednesday 03/29/2017</p>
    <p>Bobby gave an update that the ICD will be performed on Thursday, 03/30/2017</p>

<h3>Trivia Question:</h3>


<h4 class="bold">March's Question</h4>
<p>How many people are sent to the hospital for dog bites every minute in the US?</p>
<p>Answer: <span class="info"> 40</span></p>
<p>A pack-a-day smoker will lose approximately 2 teeth every (how many) years? </p>
<p>Answer: <span class="info"> 10 years</span></p>

<p class="bigBold">Fun Fact about the old red and white water tower. Thank you to John Talbert…great memory.</p>

<p>When Luscombe Aircraft Co. relocated from Connecticut in 1945, the new location on Jupiter Road in Garland had no water service since it was on the edge or out of the city limits.  The company drilled a water well into the Trinity water sands (best I remember was about 1100 ft deep) and erected a 155' tall water tower just west of the original Building 500 and south of the future Building 549.  I don't remember the capacity in gallons.  It was painted the usual red and white pattern that is normal for airports of that time.  Water from the well was about 105F and rather warm so had to be cooled before most uses.  When the city had water available, the company entered into a contract that sold the well and the tower to City of Garland.  The contract had a clause that stated that if the well and tower were no longer used by the city for the municipal system, they had to remove the tower with the well and property reverting to the company.   As the city system grew and more towers were added, there were differences in the elevations of the other city towers and that caused problems. There were times that water would be spewing out of the top of the tower due to the pressure differentials.   The city tried to give back the tower but with the knowledge that it had no use, that offer was refused.  The city proceeded to sell the tower to the city of Mabank.  It was then dismantled and re erected in Maybank.  Facilities then removed the well pump and closed the well with concrete.  When the north parking lot was added, everything was paved over.  All visible remains of the original water system were gone.
</p>
<p>There was a story that way back in the early Temco days, Mr. Wheeler, (Maintenance supervisor) wanted the tower repainted.  The lead painter was Major Farrar and he said that he would do it as soon as Mr.  Wheeler laid the tower on its side. It never was repainted while in Garland.</p>

<h4>Ed Tajchman</h4>
    <h4>March 2, 1934 - December 19, 2016</h4>
    <img class="obitSize" src="./photos/edTajchman.jpg"><p></p>
    <p>Edwin Joseph Tajchman was born (March, 2, 1934) and raised on a farm near Pilsen, Kansas. His family primarily spoke Czech in the house while they were growing up, and ate many kolaches, rohlickys, and other delicious Czech foods his mother Rose always kept on hand.  The rigors of farming life produced a strong, resourceful young man.  A bad year of drought persuaded him to try college at Wichita State. After a year, he decided to enlist in the Army and joined a unit focused on advanced TV technology.  His army buddies nick named him the “Kansas Sand Hog” when he let air out of the tires on his jeep during a deployment in rough terrain, a trick honed in muddy fields back on the farm.  After his discharge, he went on to study electrical engineering at Kansas State University on the G.I. Bill and there met an amazing young woman who grew up on a farm in western Kansas.  He married Peggy Tillotson, both finished their Bachelors degrees, and they moved to Denver to start their family and a new life together.</p>
    <p>The family quickly grew as they brought Ron, Tim, Gary, and Margi into the world and eventually to the house on Fillmore Street, where they made many life long friends.  Ed pursued his Masters degree at Denver University while employed at Denver Research Institute.  His work at DRI took him on special assignment to the South Pacific to do top secret research, which not surprisingly, he kept secret his whole life. He was recruited by a startup formed out of the DRI staff to make real the dreams of Lee Harrison to automate the laborious process of creating animation for TV and the big screen. Like any startup, Computer Image had its highs and lows, but the high points were pretty amazing. He broke new ground as one the first people to actually do computer animation.  And as he rose through the ranks, eventually becoming Chief of the Engineering department, he met many famous people who came to their startup space along the Platt River including Jim Hensen, Tommy Smothers, and Chuck Jones. He traveled around the world to such places as Luxembourg, Chile, and Japan to help meet the demand for their pioneering technology.  All while raising a family of four kids and pursuing his Ph.D. in electrical engineering at DU, which he received in 1974.  In one of his proudest moments, he and Lee Harrison accepted the Emmy Award in 1973 for outstanding technical achievement for the development of the Scanimate computer animation system.  </p>
    <p>Computer Image’s analog technology was very successful in 1970’s but digital animation techniques held the day as digital computers became more and more ubiquitous.  When they finally closed the doors he found a new job at E-Systems (now Raytheon) in Garland, Texas, in 1987.  He enjoyed a long and successful career at Raytheon, retiring in 2010 after Peggy passed away, spending the last years of his life taking care of his daughter.  He died in the comfort of his home, surrounded by his family on December 19, 2016. Through all his accomplishments and successes, he was always a humble man who led by example.  Anyone who was lucky enough to spend time with him grew to adore, admire, and love him. And he was an amazing polka dancer.</p>
    <p>In lieu of flowers, please consider making a donation in Ed’s name to one of his favorite charities, the North Texas Food Bank, ntfb.org. A viewing will be held at Eastgate Funeral Home, 1910 Eastgate Drive, Garland, Texas from 6 to 8 pm on Tuesday, December 27, and a funeral mass will be held at Saint Joseph Catholic Church, 600 South Jupiter Road, Richardson, Texas on Wednesday, December 28, at 10:30 am.</p>

<h4>Wendy Sue Rickman</h4>
    <h4>October 10, 1953 - August 24, 2016</h4>
    <img class="obitSize" src="./photos/WendySueWickman.jpg"><p></p>
    <p>Wendy Sue Rickman age 62 died on August 24, 2016 at the VA North Texas Hospital. Wendy was born on October 10, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York to Elmore and Maxine Rickman. She grew up there and after high school pursued her passion of becoming a nurse. She graduated Nursing school in 1977. She immediately began work at the Brooklyn VA hospital. She worked there until 1985 when she proudly joined the Air Force. She received a Master’s Degree in counseling from Midwestern State University while on active duty. After her service as a captain in the Air Force she moved from Wichita Falls to Dallas in 1990. Wendy was currently still practicing as an RN and psychotherapist. She has helped many people in her private practice and through her Road to Recovery outpatient practice. She was passionate about her work helping others.</p>

    <p>She presently resided in Garland Texas with Martin Trevino. She is also survived by her nephews Jeremy Rickman and Ethan Rickman whom she loved as sons, also her sisters in law Suzanne Gray and Joni Ellis. She is preceded in death by her brothers Robert Rickman and Bruce Ellis.</p>

    <p>Wendy was a spiritual woman with a strong relationship with God. This was evident in everything she did. She is deeply loved by many. If you would like to attend her viewing it will be Saturday August 27, 2016 at 5:00 P.M and Funeral Service at 6:00 P.M. at Aria Cremation Service, 10116 E Northwest Highway, Dallas, TX 75238</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Although Wendy was not an E-Systems/Raytheon employee, she was a long time friendly face at Garland. She helped many employees through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), so, I thought  ya’ll might like to know about her passing last week.</span></p>

    <p>Bill Ersthaller’s son Paul has sent me Bill’s WW II military diary from when he was a B-24 navigator to share with the retirees. Marv has added a link to it from the website. It will be password protected with the same password as the member directory file. I have read a few of the entries already and it is very interesting. The book has also been published once and is currently in its second edition printing. If you like what you see and would like a hardcopy let me know and I’ll ask Paul if we can order. He would love to get feedback about the diary as well.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Reeder Barkman: </span>Reeder missed the luncheon again. He must be feeling bad because he hasn’t been to the last four or five luncheons.<br>
        <span class="bold">From Reeder himself with his permission: </span>I miss going to the luncheon.  The Cancer has gotten into my right leg and I can’t stand very long without it hurting.  I got dehydrated and the  VA put me in the Hospital for a couple of days and while I was there I had a fall and had to stay longer.  The pain is still in my right hip and they are talking about Radiation on that hip.  Soon, I hope.  My Doctor said that might take the pain away.  Not much good going on.  My Sister is on life support now and no hope.  (She actually passed away today)</p>

    <h4>March 21, 1924 – June 14, 2016</h4>
    <img class="obitSize" src="./photos/EllaLousieDouglas.jpg"> <p></p>
    <p>Ella Louise Pinder Douglas (Louise)was born March 21, 1924 in Greensboro, Maryland to Herb &amp; Elsie Pinder and passed away June 14, 2016. She is survived by her daughters Marilyn Lawley &amp; husband Larry; Tammy Douglas; son Jeff Douglas &amp; wife Theresa; grandchildren Shelley Werner &amp; husband Coy; Lisa McLeod; Stacey Guenther &amp; husband Mike; Ellee Wolverton; great-grandchildren Jennifer Werner, Matthew Werner, Mitch McLeod, &amp; Brittany Quaila, Lillie Faith Olivo, Lilian Grace Guenther; great great-grandchildren Damien Werner, Kaleb Quaila &amp; Olivia Quaila.</p>

    <p>SERVICES for Louise are Monday, June 20, 2016 at 1:00 PM in Williams Memorial Chapel, with a visitation the night before at Williams Funeral Directors from 6:00-8:00 PM</p>

    <p>Louise had been a Garland resident since 1954. She was an active member of First Christian Church until she was struck by Alzheimer&#39;s. It started out with confusion but steadily progressed over the past 8 years to where she no longer knew her family &amp; friends. She was a strong-willed woman &amp; fought to hang on until we finally convinced her to let go so she could go to be with our Lord &amp; reunite with our dad who passed in 1979. Being the strong woman she was, she settled into widowhood. She worked for a number of years to finish raising two children who came along later in life. She retired from E-Systems &amp; loved the Women&#39;s Club going along on their many trips.</p>

        <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>
        <h4>Ron Oliver</h4>
        <p>Ron had to have day surgery for an eating problem. He still has the nerve damage resulting from his Kidney removal surgery and can’t walk at all</p>
        <h4>Update on Al and Wanza Holley from Al himself:</h4>
        <p>Hello from Al Holley August 31:</p>
        <p>Last day of August, Summer is over ...... In the olden days it was time to start picking cotton, pulling bolls, digging the potatoes and gathering the last of the corn crop.  The Hay crop came around the end of September. There was never an end of the work on the farm, only the beginning for winter. The lucky one's got to start to school on Sept 1, but the Farm Kids had to wait until around Oct. 1, to be able to start. Even they would sometimes be delayed until around the end of Oct. Hog killing and gathering the nut crop was the norm in October and November. People do not remember the hardships we went through during the Depression Times. Some children never got the chance to even start until after Christmas. Thankfully we are not in that situation today, but I am beginning to wonder how long we can stay away from those days. Today I feel fine and had a good night's sleep. We had our coffee around 5:15 and Wanza is feeling great as well. We will take Wanza  to the Specialist on Friday to get a fitting for her foot brace. It will take another two weeks to have it prepared. She is still undergoing her feet and leg exercises at home each day though. I am also doing my exercises for my feet and legs as well. I will contact her PCP today concerning the new medication for her  bones. That medication was stopped a couple of years ago due to the damage to her teeth. We would like to find out if there is an alternative medication.</p>
            <p>The swelling in my legs and feet have been reduced to nearly normal. I have been wearing the Medical, tight fitting white hose, and sleeping with my feet and legs elevated. Thankfully, the lady taking care of Wanza has been a Healthcare Aid for over 20 years, and she has been a great help in this.
        <p>UPDATE September 8th:</p>
        <p>Today I go to see the Wizard. The Wizard is the Physician that did the operation on my back. His name is Dr. Orosco, but to me he is a Wizard. I am nearly completely free of any soreness, and beginning to walk more upright each day. Who knows, I soon may be able to slap the spouse around.. She warned me right after marriage.  If I should get violent I would have to eventually go to sleep.  Then she would get even. That woman can be cruel.</p>
        <p>At 4:50 this morning I am lying awake and thinking of my leg cramps again and there is sound in the background. Yes, it is Wanza ready for her coffee. We always do a bit of joking around at coffee time. I sing to her in a voice that is full of grunts and whistles, but my best. Somehow, she always manages to tell me to quit or just shut up. I guess a career in Music is not my calling. She is ready for the leg brace fitting again, but that is a week or so away. She is doing everything she should be doing to get back her lost abilities. I just hope the foot brace is the answer. Both of us are now as well as most people of our age, so we are not griping about anything. Wanza is just anxious to be able to walk around again, even if she has to use a walker.</p>

    <p><span class="emphasis">The Raytheon Luncheon</span> was awesome! I know I thoroughly enjoyed it and seeing everyone!</p>

    <p>Stan Scates, Program Manager of the Raytheon CityLine Project, presented us with an overview of the overall CityLine Project including the new Raytheon construction. Very interesting! Thank you to Stan! The bar-b-q spread was delicious. My apologies to those at the tail end of the line. I hope you got some sausage even though the beef ran out. “Where’s the beef?” We were visited by well over a hundred current employees which was so wonderful! Shout out to the Raytheon team who helped plan/coordinate the event for us…Stan Sims (Facilities Manager), Albert Valenzuela and Mike Farris (Security), Cindy Gamble, Jennifer Thompson, Tim Moore, and all the volunteers that gave their time to be “Escorts.” It all came together and it was nice to visit the site once more. A big thanks to Mary Ellen Myers who cheerfully greeted everyone with a badge at the entry gate! She also wins the prize for travelling the longest distance to the event…from New Mexico! I’ll be mailing her a genuine Raytheon Mouse Pad as her prize! ;o)</p>
    <p>Be watching for pictures….Todd Carr took so many pictures that he filled his memory card! Thanks so much, Todd!</p>

    <p>Thank you everyone for coming and for the kind words during and afterwards. It was an honor to be involved in this reunion and hopefully, maybe, possibly, we can do it again next year when the new buildings are occupied. So many great memories from 1200 S. Jupiter Rd. We didn’t even realize they were great at the time. We are fortunate to have them. So many current employees and future ones don’t know what they missed! Speaking of memories...I’m going to use the trivia questions that were submitted for a fun challenge. The answer will be in next month’s meeting notes. Look below!</p>

        <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>
        <h4>Update on Al and Wanza Holley from Al himself:</h4>
        <p>Hi to all from Tom Kummer,</p>
        <p>My night was nothing to brag about. I think I went overboard with my walking yesterday. My back felt like there was no vertebrae in the area needed for bending over. When the back hurts, the legs feel a little pain. I had just enough pain to make me restless and I finally decided to take another Pain Pill. I only took one, but that was the first I had taken since the first day from the Hospital. I feel OK this morning, but I will utilize the wheelchair more today than yesterday.  I am doing exercise routines each morning with the bicycle pedals. I will change my routines on leg exercises a bit today. </p>
        <p>Wanza is still going along fine, but walking, even with a walker, is not showing much increase. I am hoping the leg brace will assist her in keeping her right foot in the proper position while walking. She will go for a fitting on Friday of next week, and it will take around two week to prepare the brace to improve her right foot positioning. She is not in any pain to speak of at this time. Her vital signs are still well below a level that would cause concerns. She has always been a fighter, and that is still in her actions. </p>

        <h4>Tom Kummer</h4>
        <p>Tom felt well enough to attend the luncheon today. He a report from the Surgeon who will remove his Gall Bladder in two weeks.</p>

        <h4>Art Harding</h4>
        <p>A note from Joe Shero with good news on Art Harding's health progress.</p>
        <p>I talked with him on Monday and I'm really glad to say that is doing super.
He sounds great and has only two more infusions before being listed as
"cancer free"! </p>
        <p>It was such a surprise to hear from him ....... and he was bouncing off the
 wall. He was, and is my best friend out there. After he had received the
good news, his wife Mary kept saying ........... why don't you call Joe and
I was so thrilled to hear that he was ok. He was very happy that everyone
has been praying for him! He said he will be back after his last two treatments</p>
        <p>Thank everyone for keeping Art and all of our sick and hurting co-workers from
E-Systems and Raytheon in your thoughts and prayers. All of you are special to us.</p>

        <h4>Mildred Fisher</h4>
        <p>From Rita Hall and Carolyn Boone<br \>
Mildred used to work in the MIC Lab. Her daughter Karen Fisher Smith is a former E-Teamer and her son-n-law, Jay Smith, is still working at Raytheon. Mildred has recently been diagnosed with cancer.

<h3>Retiree Lunch at Garland Site: </h3>
<p>Yesterday we had a drawing for the additional spots that Raytheon squeezed in for the September 23rd luncheon. As you know we are limited in space and we had more people respond than they have room for. The results of the drawing are listed in order with the first seven names having a reserved spot. Beginning at number eight will be standby spots in case there are cancellations. If you have changed your mind about attending, please let me know (469-475-4884 or <a href="mailto:emmawahlstrom@aol.com">emmawahlstrom@aol.com</a>) so I can fill your spot. If you are one of the first seven below, please mail your $10.00 check made out to me as soon as possible. I wish they had room for everyone to go. It's disappointing that some folks have to be declined. My address is 7714 Princeton Rd., Rowlett, TX, 75089.</p>

<p>As a reminder, unfortunately, we will not be able to roam around, even if escorted, however, the word is already spreading and there will be time dedicated for current employees to visit with us in the Learning Center. I know this may be disappointing for some, but, 100 retirees roaming the halls could get very disruptive for all those "young uns" working to support our pensions!</p>

<p><span class="emphasis">VERY IMPORTANT!</span> I asked about camera phone policy. They are allowed, BUT, no photography allowed with your phone or personal camera. I will try to get a Raytheon photographer for a little while and/or to take a picture of the group in front of the lobby.</p>

        <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>
        <p>Hi to all from Tom Kummer,</p>
        <p>
                I recently had a mild stroke and was sent to the Presbyterian Hospital Emergency and spent two days there. After coming home, two days passed and I became very ill and ended up in the Presbyterian emergency room again. I spent twelve days in the hospital because of an infection in my gallbladder. They ran a drainage tube between my ribs and into the gallbladder where in has been for six weeks.  The Surgeon and my Cardiologist are conferring on the results of my stay in the hospital to decide if my heart can withstand the major surgery. Meanwhile, I still have my drainage bag hanging by my side. I miss not going to the Luncheon but hope to make it soon.
            <br>Say Hi to all,
            <br>Tom Kummer
        </p>
        <p>
                Don Schools is doing well after two different medical procedures. He had an endoscopic scan of his stomach to check an ulcer. It has healed up on its own. Last week he had a cardio procedure, ablation, to correct an irregular heartbeat. It was a success.
        </p>

        <p>My wonderful wife just moved from my house to God's house. She was one strong lady that fought this horrible disease until her frail little body finally gave out. We couldn't have made it without our countless friends and your prayers. I hope I can thank each of you personally in the days to come. <br>When I know more, I will let you know.
<br>God bless you, Wayne Glasson</p>
        <p>Wayne Glasson recently took his beautiful wife home from the hospital to be cared for by hospice. Mary Jo had fought the good fight against the ravages of cancer, but one all too often fails to win that fight in the long run. So today we are sending our condolences and prayers to our friend, Wayne. Please join me in those expressions with faith for Wayne’s strength in this time of sorrow.</p>
        <p>Written by Billy Mata, July 20, 2015: Mary Jo Glasson - went home to be with our Lord and savior today (July 19th). If there was a definition of the perfect musician’s wife, it would be her. As far a person goes, there's not a soul out there that can say one bad thing about this woman. She was everyone's friend and if you were in need, she would be first in line to help. We're gonna miss her so and I ask for prayers for her and her family, especially Wayne. She was and always will be his everything. God bless you my brother.</p>

            <p>If you need your Retiree List information added or updated please email Marv Olson at <a href="mailto:esyraywebmaster@gmail.com">Click Here</a>. If you would like to be added to the email distribution list you must send Marv a request</p>

            <p>Jim Gray is still taking orders for the Retirees’ Luncheon 25th Anniversary photo.</p>


            <h3>Retiree Lunch at Garland Site: </h3>
            <p>As most of you know, the Garland Site E-Systems/Raytheon retirees have been invited to conduct our September luncheon meeting at the Garland site. This invitation comes to us as our opportunity to say "Good bye" to the site before it is vacated and the legacy we all left behind becomes a memory. We each have our own remembrances and one more walk through the front lobby will be bitter-sweet. <br>Well...enough of that. </p>

            <p>Please take note that the date for the luncheon meeting is the <span class="emphasis">23rd of September at 11:00</span> ...not the last Wednesday as is customary. The room (Learning Center) is not available on the 30th. We will be served a delicious bar-b-que lunch with all the fixins, including cobbler for desert, at a cost of $10.00 each. Raytheon is subsidizing the rest. The cafeteria is well known for making a great brisket and sausage spread! YUM! Prepayment can be by cash or check made to me (Eileen Wahlstrom) since I will be paying with my credit card.</p>
            <p>The room's tabled seating capacity is 100 people so I will need to collect names of those attending. With this in mind, only retirees are invited. If there are special circumstances where a spouse needs to accompany a retiree for mobility reasons, etc. please let me know. The list of attendees will need to be submitted to Security beforehand so everyone is in the Visitor Registration System. More on that and where we will park to come later. </p>
            <p>Last but not least, unfortunately, we will not be able to roam around, even if escorted, however, the word is already spreading and there will be time dedicated for current employees to visit with us in the Learning Center. I know this may be disappointing for some, but, 100 retirees roaming the halls could get very disruptive for all those "young uns" working to support our pensions!</p>
            <p>I'll keep you all informed as I get more information. You can go ahead and RSVP via email or text now (469-475-4884.) As soon as we reach 100 I will let everyone know, but, your $10.00 will hold your spot. The signup sheet was circulated at the July meeting and will also be at the August meeting. </p>
<p>Thanks everyone! See you soon</p>

        <h3>SICKNESS:</h3>
        <p>Ron Oliver has been in a wheelchair since his surgery early this year. He is in the hospital now</p>
        <p>
                Wanza Holley: <br>“The Exercise people are keeping Wanza busy with exercises. It seems like a slow train, but I can see improvement each week. She has such a long road to go before she will be able to function on her own. Today, she covered 35 steps by utilizing the Walker and the Therapist holding onto the Gate belt around her waist. You may laugh at such a milestone, but consider her mental state. She is afraid she will break the leg again. They have let her know that another broken leg will probably see her in a wheelchair for the rest of her days. Her vocabulary is on the minus side. I would be bragging to say she has over 30 words in her vocabulary.”
        </p>
        <p>
                Allan Holley:<br> “The back pains have returned with a vengeance. I go in for another Epidural in two more days. Most of the pain is in my right hip and leg. That is area they will concentrate on this week. I am able to walk with a walker or by bending over quite a bit, but I am limited on the distance. Several options are open and we are in the beginning stage for now.”
        </p>
        <p>Dottie talked to Darla Wycoff and her husband had back surgery and is doing ok.  He went home on June 9th</p>
        <p>Dottie asked if anyone living near H.C.Chancey in Richardson could check in on him since it has been so long since she has heard anything from him. He lives on Rorary St.</p>
        <p>Art Harding had surgery for colon cancer about 2 months ago. Joe Shero reported that Art is starting Chemo treatments.</p>
        <p>Sue Hartson’s daughter, Kim Hartson, had surgery on June 15 and is doing fine</p>

        <h3>DEATHS:</h3>
        <p>Eager, Donald Ray</p>
        <p class="italic">July 23, 1939 - May 31, 2015</p>
        <img src="./photos/eager1.png">
        <p>Donald “Don” Ray Eager, age 75, passed away peacefully on May 31, 2015 at his home in Garland, TX with his family. Don was born July 23, 1939 in Denver, Colorado to the late Leslie H. and Mary Huckaby Eager. As a child he lived in Littleton, Colorado, Amarillo, Texas, and McAllen, Texas before moving to Minden, Louisiana. Don graduated High School in Minden, Louisiana in 1957 and went on to attend Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, LA. During the summers in college he worked for the US Geological Survey. He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Louisiana State University in 1961. Upon graduation, he worked briefly for NASA before being inducted into the US Army.</p>
        <p>In the Army he was stationed at White Sands Missile range in NM.  He was honorably discharged from the Army in 1964. After his discharge, Don attended New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, NM obtaining a Masters of Science Degree in Electrical Engineering in 1965 and a Doctor of Science in Electrical Engineering  in 1967.  Upon graduation, he moved to Richardson, TX to begin his career.  He worked for Texas Instruments and LTV before finding a home at E-Systems (now Raytheon)  in Garland, TX where he worked from 1972 until his retirement 1994.</p>
        <p>After his retirement from E Systems, Don continued his love of learning by obtaining a Master of Arts from Amber University in 1994 and a Master of Science in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience from University of Texas at Dallas in 1999.  Don wrote and published software titles including a successful Spanish language learning program</p>
        <p>Reading on a wide range of topics was always a favorite activity for him. Don enjoyed wide open spaces and over the years took many trips to western states, especially to Colorado. He loved his family and spoiled his dogs. He will be deeply missed.
 Donald Ray Eager is survived by his wife, Eva Bowland Eager, sons, Eric and Michael, as well as his grandsons, Collin and Cameron.</p>
        <p>Note:  I met Don while we both worked on Special Projects.  He owned some property just over into Louisiana and I went with him one weekend to clear an overgrown road going back into his place.  He used a chainsaw on small trees in the road and I used hand tools.  Hot, humid, a lot of vines.  I was going to bring some firewood back but was just too tired to mess with it when we got ready to come back.  That was a rough weekend.
        </p>
        <p>Don was a good woodworker.  He built a wooden console for Walt Culver’s van and it was a work of art.  He was very meticulous.  That must have been 28-30 years ago.  Jerry Bryant</p>

                <strong>BIG NEWS!!</strong>
                    <p>
                        I was asked to help plan a special “Farewell to the Garland Site” visit for our retirees.
                        I suggested the August lunch meeting as the date. To quote Karen Ebling: “Our retirees have
                        their blood, sweat, and tears in the Garland site. It’s very appropriate that they get a chance
                        to say goodbye.” Mark your calendars so you don’t miss it! More later!
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Feel free to send me information for next meeting to <br>

<p>
    The torch has been passed after many years, 25 so I’m told, from Queen Dottie to me...Eileen Wahlstrom. Please be patient with me as I attempt to fill her
    shoes by reporting the details shared at the meetings with all of you, my fellow retirees. Don’t throw too many tomatoes at me while I speak about our
    concerns. I will do my best to include what you are used to hearing about as well as welcoming your input. Contrary to what Reeder Barkman may tell you, I
    don’t know everything (or maybe he says I’m a “know it all”.) Just kidding, Reeder. Hugs! If you have something you want mentioned or asked at the meeting,
    send me an email at <a href="mailto:emmawahlstrom@aol.com">emmawahlstrom@aol.com</a>. Also, don’t be shy. I encourage your participation at the meeting.
    Most of all, I know I speak for everyone by saying a huge “THANK YOU” to Dottie for her dedication to a job well done.

<p><span class=bold>WOW</span>; what a wonderful meeting. Sorry I can not remember all of those who have not been at all or hve not been there for a while. It was certainly great seeing each and everyone.</p>

<p>Jim Gray made a group picture of us all, he would like to know how many would like one.  They will be $5.00 each,  so let me know, or Marvin Olson, or Tom White. </p>

<p>Some one asked me how the retirees started: It was started by Charlie Tipton, Benny Poarch and Bob Ross. Held on the the last Wednesday of the month beginning in January 1990.</p>

<p>Benny was our first spoken, can not remember if there was one before Bob Sale.  Benny had to give it up because of illness.  Bob had it  for several years.  I remember I started the Sympathy Cards</p>

<p>Probably in 96 or 97 Tom White started the Web-Page, I opened my big mouth said I would do the minutes, I don't even like to take minutes.I went by what Bob gave me.  Tom also took care of the
address, till a few years ago,  then Les Ewing took it over.  He has given that up and Tom has it again for a while.Marvin Olson took over the Web-Page .We take up a collection for the
web-page when it is needed.  Sometimes we will  have copies made, especialy for those that do not have a computer.</p>

<p>So all the retirees, new and old ones, you need to give your address, phone #, and e-mail too Tom. If you had a land phone and changed to cell phone that needs to be checked also.</p>

<p>We also need to thank Juanita the Manager at Furr;s for helping us on Wednesday, they always do a great job.</p>

<p>Guys don;t forget Valentine Feb. 14,  thanks for putting up with me too.
    will see you Feb.25.</p>

                    During the discussion part of the meeting, John
                    Talbert related about how the company buildings got
                    their numbers and it was only coincidental with the
                    approximate year of their construction. Back
                    in the TEMCO days, each facility ( Grand Prairie,
                    Garland, and Greenville) was assigned a series of
                    numbers for the buildings. The Garland
                    buildings started with Building 500 which was
                    constructed at the time that the predecessor company
                    Luscombe Aircraft Co moved from the northeast to
                    Garland in 1946. Buildings 501 502 503 up to
                    550 were added in short order. Construction of
                    551 started in approximately 1954 with 552 following
                    immediately. The antenna test range tower
                    building 579 was added in approximately 1968.
                    Construction was fairly quiet until 1979 when
                    business boomed and buildings 580, 581, 582, 583 584
                    and 585 were all added by 1986. Planning was
                    all set on building 584 to be expanded from a two
                    story structure to a four story structure.
                    Unfortunately business cooled and that was cancelled
                    along with the future 586. As the saying goes,
                    the rest is history.<br>
                    <br>
                    The hosting fee for the website will be due shortly
                    and donations were requested to cover that.
                    Also, Tom White would like to have a website and
                    mailing manager trainee in place if he becomes
                    unable to continue. If anyone would like to
                    volunteer, it takes about an hour a month.
                    Some additional time would be required if there are
                    a lot of announcements (deaths, illness, etc) to go
                    out during the month.<br>

                    Don’t forget the 25 year anniversary of the Retirees
                    Luncheon Group will be January 28.<br>

                    LBJ. Also, her daughter Barbara passed
                    away Jan. 2013.<br>
                    <br>
                    Jim Hester visited us today, had not seen him in
                    about 3 years. Jim had an e-mail from Mark
                    Reid whose wife Lois is in a nursing home in
                    Mineola, It is very nice, I have a close
                    friend there.<br>
                    <br>
                    Remember those that are having health issues, it is
                    not easy sometime, they do need our prayers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Do me a favor, call some one that has not been at
                    our meetings in a few months, ask how they are
                    doing. They will appreciate the call and
                    concerns about them.<br>
                    <br>
                    Hope all had a great Farther's Day.<br>
                    <br>

                      <big>I have talked with Mr. H. C. Chancey this
                        last week, he is still about the same,
                        holding his own.<br>
                        <br>
                        Talked with Ron Oliver. His wife is quite ill,
                        and someone needs to stay with her, their son
                        does live with them, that helps.<br>
                        <br>
                        John Barkman (Reeder) was there today, good to
                        see him. He does look good, has lost some
                        weight but that's o.k.<br>
                        <br>
                        Remember Patsy Samford, who is in a nursing
                        home.<br>
                        <br>
                        Dolores Howle German she was at the Village at
                        Lake Highlands. I did not get a chance to
                        check on her, or Barney Barnhart but I will
                        before our next meeting.<br>
                        <br>
                        This is early, but in 2015 the retirees will
                        have been meeting for 25 years, so we are
                        looking forward to seeing everyone there in
                        January. Jim Gray will make a picture of
                        the group again. Pass the word around.<br>
                        <br>
                        I have name tags for Theresa O'Brien,
                        Wayne Tibbit and Larry Stewart.<br>
                        <br>
                        Remember those that are ill, or home bound, and
                        those that have lost loved ones.<br>
                        <br>
                        Happy Mother's Day to the Mothers.<br>
                        <br>
                        Thanks for coming, will see you May 28.<br>

                        suppose to be a Lady there today, she had
                        another meeting, which is fine, cause we
                        have some time. Will will also have Jim

              a generator and she is
              ok.

              <span style="font-weight: normal;">Sorry about not being
                there Wednesday, we had a tornado in this area about
                9:00 P.M. First we had rain, then golf ball size
                hail. I did not have a lot of hail but some,
                certainly had the wind. Lights went out as I was
                going to my front bathroom, I think it is the best
                place. Wham, I got my flashlight and started looking, a
                limb from the free went though the roof into the
                ceiling, my carpet got wet. I had to get my
                neighbor to help me move my bed over so it would not get
                wet. My neighbor had already been over to
                see if I was safe. They do not speak English but are so
                caring. No lights or radio, we were having lighting and
                rolling thunder light everything. I called my daughter,
                they were watching the weather channel, Ron said
                just rain, put buckets or what ever so I could
                catch the rain. <br>
                <br>
                The City of Irving has been fantastic. A close friend
                from Church brought their generator up Wednesday about
                7:00 P.M. so I had fans going and lights. My power came
                back on Thursday afternoon about 3:00. I am well
                blessed that I don't have any more damage and am not
                hurt. No one was hurt in the area. Just</span><span

      Bobby Gambrell and Tom White talked by e-mail the first of
      August, several are unhappy with Gloden Coral. I agree it is
      not the best food. Furr's did not want us when they
      moved, and also we heard, the private room was for
      corporate. <br>
      <br>
      Anyway, I read their e-mail, and mine that I sent to them. I
      was afraid if we went to Furr's then they decided they did not
      want us Golden Coral would not take us back. <br>
      <br>
      I went over there today, before our meeting they are set up
      just like Golden Coral, their private room will only hold
      50. the table of 4 next to the door I could use.<br>

      next month, John McAdam suggested we vote today. We did. I
      would say 38 voted to stay. I did not vote.<br>
      <br>
      I do not want to hurt anyone feelings over this, there are
      very few places that can hold a group without paying . Which
      we do not have the money.<br>
      <br>
      It is nice to see everyone each month, so please come so we can
      enjoy the social.<br>
      <br>
      See you September 29th. if you travel on Labor Day

      Good Morning Tom, <br>

      The 2009 RSVP Hotline for the retirees is ready to go with lots of
      information available. Retirees will need to call and leave
      a message to rsvp their tickets. All retirees will receive
      the "GLA Ticket" pricing of $45 per person (early bird special)
      and $55 per person after November 20th. Gail Cook will be
      checking the hotline each day, will call back all reservations,
      have the retirees mail in funds, and then mail out their
      tickets. There will not be any need to pick up tickets at
      the plant. <br>

      All Retiree tickets sales will be handled through the Hotline. <br>

      It was noted that Raytheon had a layoff at the first of September
      and several had taken retirement. Attendees were encouraged
      to contact the new retirees and urge them to attend our monthly
      luncheons. Jerry Yearout has retired and sends hello to
      all. He will attend the luncheon soon.<br>
      <br>
      Retirees were encouraged to make sure that John McAdam had their

      Had an e-mail from Rick Underwood, his wife Sarah is in Baylor
      Garland with Breathing Problems.<br>
      <br>
      Did you know that out there in wide open space is a free number to
      call for information. 1-800-373-3411, certainly is better than
      paying each time to have to call for a telephone number.<br>
      <br>
      Had e-mail from Nannette and Gene Slaughter, their daughter Gena
      won her Judge position in Dallas, plus giving them their first
      Granddaughter. Congratulation to you both.<br>
      <br>
      Leslie and Jackie Ewing have moved to Bella Vista, Ark. We will
      miss you, try to visit us.<br>
      <br>
      We averaged 52 last year for attendance, think that is very good.
      <br>
      <br>
      During the year, we lost 20 employees, 5 spouses, and 3 others of
      next of kin.<br>

      Thanks for coming today, hope we have a very good turn out
      February 28, and John Talbert will be there, I will see you in

      </span>We owe Tom White and John McAdam a lot for keeping us
      informed with all the news of our meetings. We did take up another
      collecting today for our web page, and for John who prints out the
      retirement list every three months for those that do not have a
      computer. That is over 10.00 dollars each time. Plus the time they
      spend doing all this. So I think you people out there that get the
      news only by computers should be thankful and donate. This is the
      only way you can keep up with who and what. We do our best to
      bring to you when someone is ill or passes away. I know you enjoy
      the news I have seen some letters and heard from some.<span

      style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">The meeting began
      with Barney letting everyone know that since his first attendance
      he looks over the attendees and says a silent prayer thanking God
      for the fact he had the opportunity to work with such a great
      group of people while he was at E-Systems for 42 years. He
      made the comment that the workplace will never see another group
      of employees that worked together as well as those that worked at
      E-Systems, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      Barney then read an e-mail from Tom White stating that there are
      two options we </big><big style="font-family:
      helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">can </big><big style="font-family:
      helvetica,arial,sans-serif;">each utilize in order to get
      the latest time critical information such as deaths and funerals
      that John McAdam has been sending out. The reason for the
      change is due to John changing Internet Service Providers and they
      will not allow him to send email directly to multiple (400)
      recipients. More info to the left under <span style="color:
        rgb(255, 0, 0);">NEW</span>.<br>
      <br>
      Each one that wants to recieve the emails needs to subscribe
      to the EsyRayRetirees Yahoo Group. The easiest way to
      subscribe is to utililize the subscription block to the left
      below. Just enter you email address and click the purple
      Yahoo block. <br>
      <br>
      The other way to subscribe to the email group is to send a blank

        style="font-family: helvetica,arial,sans-serif;"></span>I was
      wondering where Tom White was today. I found out that Jerry his
      wife, was at Texas Retina Associates on Tuesday checking her
      eye, which had a membrane growing on the retina. They did
      surgery today at 10 AM . The Doctor said the operation went fine
      and Jerry should have a full recovery. I did not find this out
      until tonight when I started to do the minutes, Jerry, hope
      everything goes well.<br>
      <br>
      Keep Patsy, Jerry, Margie Davis and the Bell Family in your
      prayers.<br>
      <br>
      We had several guests today, to also hear our speaker Ken Benson
      from Medicare Today Coalition. Plus there were several attended
      that have not been for some time, too many to mention, I
      would leave someone out. We are always glad you came.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Benson brought quite a message for us, very informative.
      I think everyone enjoyed hearing what he had to say.<br>
      <br>
      You have probably seen what Bobby Smith sent John McAdam to put on
      E-Mail. We thanked Bobby for his work.<br>
      <br>
      Helen Hull is still working with the Santa Clause Program at the
      Plant, to help families during this time of the year. We
      passed an envelope around and collected $66.00 for the
      cause. Thank you.<br>

      Thanks for a very good turnout.<br>

      came to our rescue by inviting his friend Daniel F. DuPre'
      and Dominick Madonna to explain the Medicare
      Plan D. Which was great that we could get
      someone. It was very informative, and some are still
      confused.(me) I think we may still have to wait till we get our
      forms to fill out in Nov.<br>
      <br>
      Several had asked if we could have these two gentlemen back in
      November, they will talk to individuals after the meeting. I
      am sure that they will return.<br>
      <br>
      We do need to get the cost of medication that we take a year. That
      can be done by calling Medco if you receive it by mail, or your
      Druggist. Medco was very helpful to me.<br>
      <br>
      John McAdam asked Dominick to send him some information on the
      Plan D, he will put it on the web page.<br>
      <br>
      Sorry about the flu shots, but Carol and Terry are doing all they
      can do for us. Terry will call me when the medicine comes in, they
      will set up a day for the retirees, but if you can you need to go
      ahead and get your flu shots.Terry will also call the ones that
      have called her.<br>

      Underhill. He was killed when the single-engine plane he was in
      with a friend went down near Eagle Pass just across the Mexican
      border. Carbon monoxide leaked into the plane, they went to sleep
      and the plane flew on autopilot until it ran out of gas.
      Jaysen's wife is expecting their second child in June. A fund for
      his surviving children has been set up at Texas Credit union

    <p>Dottie, (our fearless leader) was on a vacation trip this month.
      She asked me if I would fill in. I said "No! " Apparently that was
      not an acceptable answer because she sent me the information to
      pass out at the meeting. Notice that she did not give me a check
      list, so I forgot about Guests, First Time Attendees, and
      Anniversaries.</p>
    <p>The Raytheon Holiday Party will be held again this year at the
      Apparel Mart. The theme this year is "Festival of Lights". Small
      flashlights were handed out at the Retirees Luncheon. I am
      guessing that they should be brought to the Party.</p>
    <p>Retirees who want to attend the Holiday Party should call
      972-205-5777 to receive an invitation. This is a voice mail
      number. Please leave your name address and telephone number.</p>
    <p>A question was asked about flu shot for retirees. The company has
      announced that it will not supply flu shots for retirees this
      year.</p>
    <p>A petition was signed by attendees to support HR Bill 1322. If
      passed, this bill will prevent corporations from stopping medical
      coverage for retirees among other good things for retirees. If you
      would like to learn more about this you can go to <a

      loading door of Bldg. 583, Signs will be posted, I am sure you
      will have to have a badge or be escorted.</p>
    <p>Tom White has been gracious enough to do our Web page which up
      until now has been being hosted free by Apple Computer. However
      they have decided to start charging for this service. Tom has
      checked the prices, and the new Apple price of $50 for the first
      year and $100 a year after that is about as good as any, and we
      don't have to change the Web address.</p>
    <p>I did not ask the group how they felt, but I really think
      everyone enjoys the Web page. It is a way to keep in contact for
      the ones that cannot make the meeting or live out of town, state.
      The lunch group made a donation of $76.00. That is enough to pay
      for the first year, with $26 toward the next year. We will make
      another plea for donations next July via email so that the ones
      that use the web page but don't come to the luncheons can
      contribute.</p>
    <p>Thanks to the lunch group for the donation</p>

    <p>There is a provision in the IRS tax code that permits special tax

      legacy E-Systems Retirees. The entire Raytheon Retiree Program
      (includes Texas Instruments, Hughes, Raytheon and E-Systems) is
      still under review. She did participate as the representative from
      E-Systems Corporate Benefits prior to her retirement. Lots of talk
      - no decisions at this time. She stressed that the most important
      point to remember is that Retiree Medical is very different from
      our pension benefits. It is a not guaranteed like the Pension
      Benefits and the company has reserved the right to make changes to
      the Retiree Medical program or to the costs. She will report any
      change in status as soon as she knows anything.</p>
