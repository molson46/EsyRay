    <img class="img90PercentCenter" src="./photos/BillLillAbston.jpg"><p style="clear: both;"></p>
    <p>Update about Lil and Bill Abston from their daughter - Grace</p>
    <p>Mom wanted me to give an update. If you don’t know already, they had a car accident late Sunday afternoon, March 12th, while on their way to their small group Bible study.</p>
    <p>They were t-boned on mom’s side of the car and it was totaled. Dave saw their car at the car pound and couldn’t believe the condition. They were hit three times by the same car and the car spun in circles. She was moved from the hospital yesterday to Encompass Rehabilitation Hospital in Plano on 15th St. She has a cracked sternum and she broke three ribs on the right side. Her right foot and right shoulder are hurt but thankfully neither one is broken. Her back is very sore too. She is experiencing some difficulty talking as it hurts so much. She will be at rehab for at least two weeks. Mom has her phone but it might take her awhile to answer texts and/or calls.</p>
    <p>Dad had scans Sunday night at hospital and praise God there was no re-injury to his neck. (For those who don’t know he fell while walking his daily 3-5 miles two days before Christmas and broke neck in two places. He got the neck brace off a week before this car accident. ) My brother, Dave, took him to doctor today because his leg started hurting a couple of days ago. Doctor did X-rays of his back today thinking it might be coming from back. (He started wearing a back brace several days ago.) It may be a few days for those results and depending on what they find, he may have further X-rays on leg.</p>
    <p>The seat belts and airbags did their job and we thank God their injuries weren’t worse. We thank everyone praying for them and solicit continued prayers for their recovery. It’s very hard for them to be separated from each other after 66 years (next month) of marriage.</p>
    <p>Hug your loved ones and tell them you love them!</p>
    <p>Grace  </p>
        
    <p><span class="bold">Mike Farris : </span></p>
        <p> From Rae Ann Farris:</p>
        <p>Hey Guys Mike Farris would like to thank you all for the birthday wishes. For those of you who don't know Mike was diagnosed with Stage 4 Throat and Neck Cancer Tuesday March 28. We have been in TMC Denison since that day. On Wednesday he received a trach and was taken to ICU. Thursday a PEG (feeding) Tube and Friday I witnessed the man I love endure something I will never forget. The Dr was doing a bed side trach change which is normally a simple procedure well things went down hill real fast. All of the sudden His ICU room was filled with medical staff and I was being masked and gowned. The new trach could not be inserted because it was catching on the hardware from his neck fusion. As I stood there watching and listening I began to pray. I heard one of the Dr's say get ready we have about 3 seconds then we're going in the lung. God was certainly in that room. The Dr was able to place the trach in enough to rush Mike to the OR. He came back to his ICU room with a temporary trach and his Dual Port for his treatments. Mike will be headed back to the OR Wednesday to receive what we hope to be his last trach procedure. We have an excellent team of Dr's with a game plan already in place and a even greater support team in our Families. The next few months will be very hard, please keep Mike and our team of Dr's in your thoughts and prayers. </p>

<p>arry Eugene Conroe, age 65 of Sachse, Texas, passed away Wednesday, April 19th, 2023, at Medical City Hospital of Plano.</p>
<p>He received his dual degrees from the University of Kentucky in Computer Science and Mathematics, and his MBA from the University of Dallas. He began his career with Texas Instruments.  Throughout a distinguished career, he provided leadership in Information Technology, System Engineering, and Software Engineering for Fortune Two Hundred companies before retiring after 33 years with Raytheon as an IT Director.</p>
    <p>He held membership in the International Council on Systems Engineering and the Society for Information Management, among other professional organizations.  He was COBIT certified in IT Management and Governance, ITIL certified in IT Service Management, and received numerous honors and awards including the 2005 Excellence in IT Award from Raytheon, Incorporated.</p>
    <p>Barry was an avid University of Kentucky basketball fan as well as a Dallas Cowboys fan. He would never miss a single game</p>
    <p>Upon retiring, he filled his time with mentorship, spending time with his family, playing golf, or doing landscaping in his yard</p>
    <p>He was a member of North Place Church and never wanted to miss one of Pastor Bryan’s sermons. Through the fellowship at North Place Church, he developed many meaningful relationships.</p>
    <p>Barry is survived by his wife, Sherri Conroe; daughter, Emily Conroe of Houston Texas, and son, Ryan Conroe of Denton Texas; bonus daughters: Cameron Cruz of Ashville, North Carolina, Amanda Redus (Blake) of Garland Texas, and Lauren Cruz of Sachse Texas; three grandchildren, Jagger Cruz-Bello, Memphis Redus, and Rue Redus, sister Darlene Russell (Marvin), nephew Christopher Russell; and one furry grandchild, Emily’s dog, Leon Conroe.</p>
    <p>Barry was preceded in death by his parents, Jackie and Nellie Conroe of Radcliff, Kentucky.</p>

    <h4>Benefits Administrator Change</h4>
    <p>This info was posted on our Facebook group.</p>
    <p>Alight has a benefits "Gateway" website that will be used for benefits administration. If you haven’t created an account yet you can use this link to do so, (<a href="https://rtxhealthyyou.com/enrollment-2">https://rtxhealthyyou.com/enrollment-2"</a>). The instructions indicate to go to <a href="www.yourtotalrewards.com/rtx">www.yourtotalrewards.com/rtx</a> and select "New user?". The "New user?" selection links to a couple of identifying questions and then steps you through the account setup. It recognized me and I was able to set up my account so I could create my profile and preferences. There’s also an online chat feature to talk with a benefits representative and find out additional details about benefits changes. They had my old employee email address in my profile and I had to call Alight to get that corrected (800-243-8135). Be sure to check your beneficiary information. This was blank for me so I corrected that.</p>


    <p>Alight will manage the medical reimbursement and (if it works like intended) we will be able to check our DDB balance, submit claims, authorize direct deposit, etc. online.</p>

    <p>RTX is also moving the 401K administration from Fidelity to Alight. The 401K change to Alight will not impact you if you've rolled over your 401K to personal IRA. <a href="www.yourtotalrewards.com">www.yourtotalrewards.com</a></p>
    
    <p class="importantAnnounce">IF YOU NEED HELP SETTING UP YOUR ALIGHT ACCOUNT, REIMBURSEMENT CLAIMS, DIRECT DEPOSIT, ETC. PLEASE EMAIL ME AT <a href="mailto:emmawahlstrom@aol.com">emmawahlstrom@aol.com</a>. TERRY GAUS HAS OFFERED TO HELP THE RETIREES WHO MAY HAVE QUESTIONS. I CAN ALSO HELP NAVIGATE THE SWAMP IF YOU NEED ASSISTANCE.</p>
