<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">As we've explained in past issues of the
Benefits newsletter, a cross-functional design team has been
evaluating Raytheon's many pension plans. The team has completed its
review and presented findings and recommendations to senior
leadership. The resulting decision is to continue the current pension
plans and not make any changes for the foreseeable future.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica"><B>What This Means to You</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica">This decision means that employees will
remain in their current pension plan. The provisions of your current
pension plan have not changed. We will soon be distributing copies of
pension plan summary plan descriptions(SPDs) to all employees. Please
watch your mail at home for your copy early next quarter.</FONT></P>
