    <p>MURFF, Lynn H. Lynn Murff, beloved husband, father, and friend departed this life June 19th and is now in the presence of the Lord. Born in Coalinga, California, March 8, 1940, to Herschel and Irene Murff, Lynn was raised in Midland, Texas where he played football at Midland High School then attended Texas Tech (BSEE) and SMU (MSEE). A brilliant electrical engineer, Lynn's career was spent in top level positions within the defense industry, most notably many years at E-Systems. He enjoyed jogging with no inclement weather being too extreme, a plate of chicken sour cream enchiladas, the ocean, and of course "The ultimate driving machine." Quietly strong, Lynn was a faithful, kind, and generous husband, a caring father, grand-father and uncle. Above all, he was a man of integrity. He leaves to honor his memory and example his wife Susie, his daughters Lynette and Melanie, grandson Koby, nieces Kama, Kyna and Mae, as well as a host of extended family and friends. A private family service will be held. "A job well done good and faithful servant!" Matthew 25:23</p>

    <p class="bold">We welcomed Mr. Jim Merriman from Medicare and More as a subject matter expert to answer our questions about Medicare. Mr. Merriman has 10 years experience and almost 1,500 clients who have benefited from his Medicare knowledge. Jim was very informative and I know I gained a few tips from his brief visit. He encouraged us to attend one of his free sessions to really dig into the topic. Even (and especially) if you have been on Medicare for a while, he pointed out how the Medicare rules, providers, costs, and even our personal situations change, so revaluating our current Medicare choice is very critical. The schedule can be found on his website at <a href="http://www.medicareandmore.co/" target="_b">www.medicareandmore.co</a>. Currently he offers the free session twice a month in Frisco through November and once a month is Sherman. Most likely, additional sessions will be scheduled for 2018.</p>

    <P class="bigger">THE SECRET'S OUT: COVERT E-SYSTEMS INC. COVETS COMMERCIAL SALES</P>
    <p>By John Mintz October 24, 1994 </p>
    <p>If Big Brother ever took control of the United States, E-Systems Inc. would surely be its prime contractor. Consider:</p>
    <ul>
        
        <li>E-Systems designs spy satellite gear that can snap photographs of automobile license plates from space and capture electronic communications, from phone calls to rocket telemetry.</li>
        <li>E-Systems software can analyze those spy satellite photos to see if anything has changed -- a Russian tank moved or an Iraqi missile site built -- since the last shots were taken.</li>
        <li>E-Systems can build "electronic fences" to police borders. It helped build one such network of sensors to monitor drug traffickers along the U.S. border with Mexico, and the company says it hopes to build a more sophisticated one for Saudi Arabia.</li>
        <li>And E-Systems hardware can help federal drug enforcement agencies track cocaine planes and tap drug dealers' telephones.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, E-Systems' technologies, part of the central nervous system for the nation's intelligence community, are regarded as brilliant by intelligence agencies and Wall Street.</p>
