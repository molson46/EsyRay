<p>I'm sure that Burma Shave actually saved some lives. People laughed and they were more careful!  It was a REAL "service" to America, even though it was an advertisement and it was one of the RARE "really useful" ones!</p>

<p>To My Old-As-Dirt Friends and Relatives who qualify as "old as dirt."  For those who never saw any of the Burma Shave signs, here is a quick esson in our history of the 1930s, '40s, and â€˜50s.  Before there were interstates when everyone drove the old 2 lane roads, Burma Shave signs would be posted all over the countryside in farmers' fields. They were small red signs with white letters. Five signs, about 100 feet apart, each containing 1 line of a 4 line couplet and the obligatory 5th sign advertising Burma Shave, a popular shaving cream.<p></p>
