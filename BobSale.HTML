In addition to giving away cute littletrinkets that he made, he often told us funny stories. It is reallygood to have him back and see that he has not lost his sense ofhumor. At the July 26 Retiree's meeting, Bob Sale told the storybelow about himself and Charlene Morris.</P><P><HR></P><P>Back in the old days at E-Systems I went to the Library to checkout a document I needed to read. Charlene Morris was the Librarian.She told me that the document was much in demand and had to bereturned in three days so others could check it out. I promised thatI would have it back on time, put it in my briefcase and left.</P><P>When I got back to my office, my Director Ron Dillon was waitingon me and told me that I must leave for Beirut, Lebanon at once.There were major problems with one of our antennas over there. I toldhim that they shoot at American's over there. He said that he knewthat and for me to be careful.</P><P>When I arrived on the Lebanon antenna site, I discovered that Istill had the library document in my briefcase. I was stuck there forsix weeks before I could leave.</P><P>When I finally arrived back at the plant I went straight to thelibrary fearful that Charlene would be very angry that I had kept thedocument so long and might really let me have it.</P><P>When I entered, she was busy working on some papers on her desk.Trying to distract her from the late document, I told her, "Lastnight I dreamed I married the most beautiful, wonderful and sweetestgirl in the world."</P><P><FONT FACE="Times">Without even looking up, Charlene said, "Werewe happy?"<HR><A NAME=Duck></A>At the August 30th meeting, Bob Sale's son told thisstory.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Times">A big-city, California lawyer went duck huntingin rural Texas. He shot a bird, but it fell into Bob Sale's field onthe other side of a fence. As the lawyer climbed over the fence, Bobdrove up on his tractor and asked him what he was doing. Thelitigator responded, "I shot a duck and it fell into this field, andI'm going to retrieve it." Bob replied, "This is my property, and youare not coming over here." </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Times">The indignant lawyer said, "I am one of thebest trial attorneys in the U.S.and, if you don't let me get thatduck, I'll sue you and take everything you own." Bob smiled and said,"Apparently, you don't know how we do things in Texas. We settlesmall disagreements like this with the Texas Three-Kick Rule." Thelawyer asked, "What is the Texas Three-Kick Rule?" Bob replied,"Well, first I kick you three times and then you kick me three times,and so on, back and forth, until someone gives up." </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Times">The attorney quickly thought about the proposedcontest and decided that he could easily take the old codger so heagreed to abide by the local custom. Bob slowly climbed down from thetractor and walked up to the city feller. His first kick hit thelawyer's groin and dropped him to his knees. His second kick nearlywiped the man's nose off his face. The barrister was flat on hisbelly when Bob's third kick to a kidney nearly caused him to give up.</FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Times">The lawyer summoned every bit of his will andmanaged to get to his feet and said, "Okay, you old coot! Now, it'smy turn!" </FONT></P><P><FONT FACE="Times">Bob grinned and said, "Naw, I give up. You canhave the duck!"</FONT></P><P>&nbsp;</P><P>&nbsp;</P><P></P></BODY></HTML>
